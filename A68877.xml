            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing I thinke, good Reade, if not impoſſible, yet exceeding difficult, for a Miniſter of Gods word to open his mouth with ſo much diſcretion, but that if hee ſeeke to beate downe the falſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, the weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will come betwixt, and take the blow vpon his owne head, which was neither meant nor due vnto him; and contrarily, if he feeke to raiſe vp the weake Chriſtian, the preſumptuous hypocrite will by and by lay hold on thoſe words, and peruert them quite, to the nouriſhing of his fooliſh ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. My care hath beene to tread ſo euen a path in the following Treatiſe, that I might not giue any iuſt occaſion to the ſuch miſtaking of either party. And I hope I haue ſo tempered my pen, that the poore Chriſtian ſhall not (vnleſſe in an ouer-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame brunt of tentation) be leſſe able to enioy his proper conſolation for any thing that hath beene here vttered, to the diſcarding and amazing
<pb facs="tcp:20394:3"/>of hypocrites; nor the hypocrite (vnleſſe out of an extreamity of wilfull blindneſſe) be able to neſtle himſelfe warme, in the miſapplying of comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe alone, that bee ſuch as hee alone ſeemeth to be. Now what thou art that ſhalt reade this booke, I cannot poſſibly know; and how thou wilt cenſure of me for it, as I cannot coniecture, ſo neither will I be carefull or trouble my ſelfe about it. If thou ſhalt commend me, I hope I haue a little better inſight into mine owne imperfections, than to bee tickled with thy prayſes, which perhaps thine ignorance, or partitality may giue, rather than any deſert of mine (which I know to bee none at all of any good thing) may call for and challenge: but if thou ſhalt reproach and diſpraiſe me, ſure I ſhould haue both more wit, and ſomewhat elſe to doe, than to make any account of thy diſliking and cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words; knowing (as I doe know well enough) what thou art, my fellow ſeruant, not my Maſter; a fellow-priſoner, not a Iudge. Wherefore if thou beeſt wiſe, ſaue a bootleſſe labour of ſpeaking either well or ill of mee; neither of which can aduantage thee, or doe me any good or hurt; and rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow thy ſelfe in reaping ſome profit by that which I haue here written, with a deſire and intention of profiting thee. If I haue ſpoken what thou kneweſt not before, now informe thy ſelfe: if what thou kneweſt, but conſideredſt not, now digeſt thine own knowledge, and (hauing an addition of one more witnes to the truth thou didſt formerly confeſſe) know it ſurer, know it better. If I ſeeme to thee to vtter truth, imbrace it, becauſe it is truth; if to erre,
<pb facs="tcp:20394:3"/>conſider by what reaſons thou canſt conuince me, of hauing erred; and let mine errour occaſion thee with more firmeneſſe to cleaue to the truth. In a word, thou mayeſt (if thou wilt) get ſome good by reading; if thou wilt not, who can helpe it? And (that I may bee bold a little to touch the ſore of thoſe that reade bookes, ſpecially Sermons, which yet there be not many that will reade) let mee put thee in mind, that the common fault of hearers, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to readers alſo: they heare alone, to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſpeakers gifts, or to cenſure his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: they heare not with any intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting their thoughts vpon themſelues, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues, and find out their owne faults. So in reading Sermons, the greater number reade only to ſee what a man can ſay: to iudge of his learning, reading, wit, phraſe, &amp;c. and to carpe at his defects in any of theſe. Long enough may ſuch both heare and reade, afore either the pen or the tongue will conueigh any goodneſſe into their hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou pleaſe to beſtow paines in peruſing theſe Sermons, reade them with none other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that one of trying thy ſelfe, whether thou beeſt an hypocrite, yea or no; ſo dare I promiſe thee ſome fruit of thy reading: for either (in finding out thine hypocriſie) thou ſhalt perceiue thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe, and bee capable of helpe; or elſe (in meeting with vprightneſſe) thou ſhalt enioy thy good eſtate, and be encouraged to proceede. Thus with my beſt prayers to God for thee, and the good ſucceſſe of all good labours to doe thy ſoule good, and with a requeſt of reaping one particular
<pb facs="tcp:20394:4"/>prayer of thine for me, if thou reapeſt any good by theſe lines, I bid thee kindly farewell, and reſt</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20394:6"/>his life, his mouth was a wel-ſpring of waters of life, euermore ſending forth the ſtreames of ſweete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing doctrine; ſo chiefely towards his end (in the fore-ſight of his neere approaching departure) doth hee enlarge himſelfe more than ordinarie, in diuers moſt worthy ſpeeches, to inſtruct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his ſorrowfull Apoſtles. In this Chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, intending to perſwade them to goodneſſe of life, he layes downe certaine grounds as a foundation, whereon to raiſe his purpoſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. One ground ſtandeth faſt in theſe two Verſes, which containe a ſweete and comfortable Parable, wherein our Sauiour ſets out the care, that himſelfe and his Father take of his Churches welfare. Himſelfe he compareth to the body of the Vine, from whence the ſweete ſap of all heauenly graces, is plentifully deriued to euery branch, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity and meaſure of euerie one. His Father he compares to an Husbandman, who doth plant, and mound, and dreſſe this Vine: and laſt of all, gather the fruit thereof in his owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and vnſpeakeable glory and praiſe. And (that the matter may be better noted) he proſecutes this part of the compariſon more at large, ſhewing the principall husbandry of GOD the Father about this Vine. This husbandrie is ſet out by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and parts of it. The ſubiect of Gods husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie is deſcribed by the common nature and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds thereof. The common nature is in thoſe words, <hi>Euery branch in me;</hi> that is, euery profeſſor of Chriſtian religion; euery one that maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or others beleeue, that hee beleeueth in Ieſus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20394:6"/>Chriſt, and imbraceth the heauenly doctrine of the Goſpell. Faith in Chriſt maketh a branch, I meane the externall profeſſion of faith; and if it be true, then doth it make a true branch; if hollow and fained, then a branch alone in appearance. The kindes of branches are two; ſome that do not bring forth fruit, ſome that doe. Some profeſſours of religion are ſound-hearted, and ſome are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall. And the care of the Lord extendeth it ſelfe to euery particular profeſſor of either kindes: of thoſe that carrie a ſhew of beeing Chriſtians, ſome do liue a godly life in the ſight of the world, and ſome doe not; and the Father of Heauen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelfe, as beſeemeth his Wiſedome, Iuſtice and Goodneſſe vnto both. And this is the ſubiect of his Husbandry.</p>
                     <p>The parts of it are two; and thoſe different, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different kinds of branches; <hi>The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull branch he cuts off:</hi> that is, the hypocrite he doth bring to eternall deſtruction, fitting and ripening him for hell, by more and more ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him from Chriſt, and all the benefits of Chriſt, till hee haue finally brought him to damnation. Euery falſe Chriſtian, whoſe life is not in ſome degree and good meaſure agreeable to his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is by God plagued and puniſhed with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death; and euery of Gods ordinances, and whatſoeuer elſe befalleth him, is turned (through his owne wickedneſſe, and Gods iuſt hand againſt him) into a meanes of working out, and increaſing his damnation. And this is one part of the Lords Husbandry, his ſeuerity againſt hypocrites. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20394:7"/>ſecond part is that, that concernes good branches, repreſenting the goodneſſe of God or the ſound-hearted Chriſtian, ſet out in the matter, and end or effect of it. The matter is <hi>purging</hi> or <hi>pruning.</hi> The Gardener with his pruning-knife doth cut off ſuch vnprofitable and luxuriant twigges from the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as would hinder the increaſe of grapes: ſo God by diuers meanes which hee hath in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and by name, afflictions, ſanctified to that purpoſe, doth diminiſh, ſubdue and mortifie the corruptions and diſordered affections of his true-hearted ſeruants, which would elſe hinder them from liuing in holy and Chriſtian manner before him. The end of this pruning, and alſo the effect (for theſe two termes are often incident, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, if a wiſe and ſufficient worke man haue the managing of any buſineſſe) is no hurt to the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but euen the greateſt good that may be, for the increaſe of their fruitfulneſſe, the cauſing of all vertues to grow in them, and the enabling of them more and more to conforme their liues according to the doctrine of godlineſſe. And ſuch is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meaning of this verſe. Now I proceede to collect ſome neceſſary poynts of doctrine from thence.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt then let vs marke, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior diſtinguiſheth the branches in the Vine into two ſorts; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnfruitfull. Queſtionleſſe wee may conclude from hence, that Chriſt meant to teach vs, that in his viſible Church, there ſhould be a mixture of true-hearted Chriſtians and hypocrits.

Some are in very deed and ſubſtance, that that they are called and taken for: others haue a meere and bare name of Chriſtianitie, and nothing within them anſwerable to that name.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.1.24.47.</note> This is the point which our Sauiour teacheth alſo in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Grounds, whereof among foure kinds, one alone prooued good. So in the Parable of the field which had Tares ſowed in it, together with good Corne: in the Parable of the Draw-net, that gathered not good Fiſh alone, but much vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table filth withall. So much alſo doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifie, when he telleth vs, that all are not Iſrael,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.6.2.28.</note> which are of Iſrael; and that hee is not a Iew, which is one without, but he which is one within. And againe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20394:8"/>of the Congregation in the wilderneſſe, hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that though all did eate of the ſame Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meate,<note place="margin">1.

And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth in plaine tearmes,<note place="margin">1.Iohn 2.19.</note> that all are not of vs (in truth of heart) which are amongſt vs, in ſhew of profeſſion. To this truth the continuall experience of all Ages yeeldeth a manifeſt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable teſtimony. In <hi>Adams</hi> family (the mother Church of all the world) there was <hi>Caine</hi> as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> both offerers to God: but the former in a falſe ſemblance of pietie; the latter, in the truth of faith and deuotion.

Wherefore it was ſo too in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; halting <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> as well as iuſt <hi>Barnabas;</hi> Corinthian flaunters, as well as true Teachers: yea, and which is more to be wondred at, falſe Apoſtles as well as true, diſperſed here and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20394:8"/>there in all Churches. Loe, how Chriſts floore hath chaffe, as well as wheate lying in it; and his field hath Goates as well as Sheepe feeding in it.<note place="margin">Reaſons why ſome be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</note> Let vs inquire a reaſon of this mixture, both why ſome be falſe, and why ſome be true. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we muſt fetch reaſons from Man, from Satan, and from God. From Man;<note place="margin">1. From Man.</note> becauſe hypocriſie is one of the euill weeds that doth naturally grow in his corrupt ſoule, it being verie agreeable to his naughty heart, to diſſemble goodneſſe in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and hauing ſeene the truth, to make ſhew of yeelding, though in heart he yeeld not vnto it. For oftentimes the truth is laid open ſo clearely before the eyes of his minde, partly through the euidenee of outward proofe, partly through the inward light of illumination, as hee cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, as the eye cannot chooſe but ſee ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as are ſet in conuenient manner and diſtance before it. Yea, many times cuſtome, education, and bringing vp in commonly receiued truths, doth ſo accuſtome and wont the minde vnto them (as vſuall eating doth the pallate vnto ſome kinde of foode), that hee cannot tell how to deny them; yea, that for his credit ſake, and out of a deſire to be well reſpected amongſt his neighbours, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bee forward in declaring his opinion of them. Nature therefore will attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profeſſion of diuine truths, with the bare helpe of a common grace of inlightning: but the true doctrine of godlineſſe, is ſo contrary to the moſt beloued luſts of men, ſo oppoſite to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruptions, and tendeth ſo wholly to beate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20394:9"/>them out of themſelues, and to bring them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection vnto GOD, that through the ſtrength of theſe corruptions, and that voluntarie ſlauerie wherein they remayne willingly enthralled vnto ſinne, they neither will nor can (indeed they cannot, becauſe they will not) giue a dutifull and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue entertainement thereunto, and ſo become but hypocrites at the beſt. So that it is no more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſee a man prooue an hypocrite, then to haue a Crow proue blacke: for the Crow doth not more naturally bring blackneſſe into the world with her, than a man doth bring with him guile and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſeeing hee hath in him ſo much imperfect goodneſſe, as will make him receiue the forme of godlineſſe, but withall ſo much tyrannizing bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as will not giue him leaue to receiue the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2 From satan.</note> the diuell is very buſie to water and cheriſh the ſeedes of guile, that are borne and bred with vs, and within vs: for out of his malice, he is very deſirous to keepe men from ſaluation, and to hold them vnder his owne command and tyranny. Wherefore if hee cannot retaine them ſtill, as his abſolute and profeſſed vaſſals, yet hee takes great paines to maintaine a more ſecret dominion ouer them, and to become the Lord of their hearts, in a more priuate and vndiſcernable manner.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore when hee is caſt out from a manifeſt domineering ouer them, by the ſhining of the Lampe of true religion within them,<note place="margin">Iohn 12.31.</note> as Chriſt ſore told that he ſhould; yet ſtill he ſtriueth by craft, and pollicie, to keepe poſſeſſion of the turret of their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20394:9"/>hearts, as being loath to bee beaten out of his old and long vſurped kingdome, ſo long as any one defenſible fort remaineth. Now the diuell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth effectually in the children of diſobedience (as the Apoſtle teſtifieth),<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.</note> and ſo finding them full apt to diſſemble, and making the matter worſe by his forcible tentations, and ſubtill inſinuations, it is no maruell if many come no further than to bare ſhewes; eſpecially ſeeing men are vſually ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in ſearching themſelues, and in reſiſting his tentations.</p>
                     <p>Laſt of all,<note place="margin">3. From God.</note> the Lord of Heauen doth moſt iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh a number of men, that liue within the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, by giuing them ouer to the diuell, and their owne hollow hearts, to be beguiled and deceiued with outward appearances of goodneſſe, ſo to auenge himſelfe vpon their careleſſe or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contempt, or neglect of the offers of grace made vnto them: for where the doctrine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Ieſus Chriſt is in any degree made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; there doth God proffer the ſpirit of grace withall, and is readie for his part to beſtow it. But when men doe neglect or reiect this goodneſſe, making more account of the baſe vanities of this world, then of thoſe moſt pretious treaſures, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them by the Lord; then doth hee moſt righteouſly depart from them, and turne them vp into the hands of Satan, to be blinded and hardned by him, and of their owne corruptions to be kept vnder, and vanquiſhed by them, that ſo hee may moſt holily accompliſh his moſt wiſe and eternall purpoſe, of glorifying himſelfe in their iuſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20394:10"/>at the laſt. And thus there is a kind of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, as well as of Satan and men, in the hollowneſſe of them that bee hollow; the Lord carrying himſelfe moſt righteouſly and wiſely: the diuell and men moſt wickedly and fooliſhly: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and attaining his owne holy and good ends, they following and ſeeking after their owne abominable and vnholy deſires. And thus we may plainely ſee how it comes to paſſe, that many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are found in Gods houſe.</p>
                     <p>Now vpon what reaſons ſtands it,<note place="margin">Reaſons why ſome be true hearted.</note> that all be not as bad as any, but that ſome doe ſincerely imbrace Chriſt? the reaſon of this alſo muſt be taken from Man,<note place="margin">1. From man.</note> and from God. From Man; becauſe hee is in his very making, capable of truth, and a ſubiect of that nature, as may haue truth wrought in it by good meanes; euen as the blind mans eye, becauſe it was a mans eye, was capable of hauing the power of ſeeing wrought in it. For it is a very falſe and cauilling exception, that is taken to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of mans ſeruitude to ſinne, when it is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hence, that a man is turned into a ſtone or trunk. Nay, man hath a ſoule indued with thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties, which may receiue the impreſſion of grace, by meanes which God doth ſanctifie for that purpoſe. Indeede ſo farre is he ſubiected to the dominion of ſinne, that hee wanteth all actiue power of conuerting himſelfe to God; but yet ſuch naturall faculties remaine within him, as that hee wanteth not a paſſiue power of being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if God conuert him. Let a mans leg bee cut, and though of it ſelfe it will nor heale or knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20394:10"/>againe; yet it hath a power of being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and knit againe, by the meanes of ſome play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or medicine skilfully applyed: but cut a ſticke of wood, or breake it in peeces, and no playſters will make vp the wound, or knit the broken peeces together againe. So is it with corrupted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; and this is all, that the truth of Gods Word will giue vs leaue to aſcribe to man, as a reaſon of his being truely ingraffed into Chriſt, he is capable of ſuch a worke of Gods Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But the Principall and onely actiue cauſe,<note place="margin">2. From God.</note> is Gods power and goodneſſe, that cauſe, beyond which, it is a madneſſe to enquire for any other cauſe. The Lord doth pleaſe to beſtow effectuall grace vpon thoſe, whom he will receiue to mercie; whereby they haue not alone their mindes inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome perceiuing of the truth of Gods word, but alſo their wills, by the mighty operation of the holy Ghoſt, ſubdued to the obedience of the ſame. So by the infuſing of a new life into them, they are inabled to become ſuch, as hee doth wiſh them to be, and as themſelues deſire to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Were it not for this grace, all in the Church would be hypocrites as well as any: but it pleaſeth the Lord to beſtow that grace vpon one (whom he hath inabled to deſire it, that hee may gratiouſly beſtow it), which to another hee giueth not, but leaueth him to his owne careleſneſſe of it; that (miſſing it by his owne default) his blood may bee vpon his owne head. So the perdition of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites is of themſelues, becauſe they willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the goodneſſe of God, which hee doth offer
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20394:11"/>them; the ſoundneſſe and happineſſe of the Saints of God, is of his free grace, that breakes the yoake of ſinne which held them vnder; and makes them willing of vnwilling, and able of vnable, to turne themſelues vnto him. For to imagine (as ſome will needes doe) that the Lord doth deale no more bountifully with one, than with another, of the members of the Church; but that the cauſe why one becomes an hypocrite, the other preuaileth to vprightneſſe, is meerely and wholly in themſelues, is a fancie (I thinke) ſo contrary to all, both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and experience of Gods Saints, that hardly can any be deceiued with it, but hee that neuer felt what it was to be vpright, and whence it came. And thus haue we laid before you the truth of this point</p>

Wee will therefore doe our beſt to lay the matter open clearely, that it may bee euidently diſcouered (to them that will take the paines of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring about the point) who is guilefull? who without guile? and for this purpoſe it is neceſſary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20394:11"/>to ſtand vpon theſe foure heads: Firſt, to ſhew what an hypocrite is: ſecondly, to ſhew the diuers ſorts, or rather degrees of hypocrites: thirdly, to ſet downe ſome generall notes of difference betwixt the true-hearted and the hypocrite. Laſtly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare more particularly the agreement &amp; diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them both, in foure principall and maine graces, whereof the one hath alone the ſhadow, the other the ſubſtance; that is, firſt, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſecondly, in faith; thirdly, in repentance; fourthly, in good life, or in obedience.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, for the deſcribing of an hypocrite,<note place="margin">What an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is; viz;</note> we muſt make vſe of a neceſſary rule of Logicke, which bids vs to define the concrete by the abſtract as they terme it, as no man can poſſibly declare what a white thing is, but by conceiuing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing what is whiteneſſe; nor what a prowd man is but by vnderſtanding what pride is; nor what an hypocrite is, but by knowing what is hypocriſie. And againe we muſt vnderſtand, that vertues and vices do not denominate their ſubiects, vnleſſe they be in them in ſo high a degree, as to preuaile and be predominant ouer their contraries: as nothing is called white, but that in which whiteneſſe ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, that it partaketh more of white, than of any other colour: and if a thing doe ſo pertake of white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we call it white, though it faile much of the whiteſt whiteneſſe that may be. So is hee called a proud man, in whom pride preuaileth; an infidell, whom infidelitie ruleth; a reuengeful man, in whom reuenge doth beare ſway; and a couetous man, in whom couetouſneſſe raigneth. And ſo muſt wee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20394:12"/>likewiſe conclude in the preſent matter, that hee is an hypocrite, in whom hypocriſie preuaileth and beareth rule.</p>
                     <p>To the making of an hypocrite therefore, three things muſt concurre:<note place="margin">A proſeſſor of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in whom hypocriſie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> firſt, a fit ſubiect; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch an one as doth (at leaſt in appearance) profeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a Chriſtian, and to beleeue in Chriſt. As nothing can bee called an vnfruitfull branch, if it bee not a branch; ſo neither can any man bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an hypocrite, vnleſſe at leaſt externally he bee in Chriſt: in this meaning, as wee now take the word hypocrite, in oppoſition to a ſound member of Chriſt. Secondly, there muſt be in that ſubiect an adiunct, that vice of hypocriſie: and thirdly, this vice muſt bee in that ſubiect, in ſuch degree as to beare to rule; and to bee, as they terme it, predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Wherefore for our further information in this matter (which is moſt exceeding needfull to be very diſtinctly knowne and conceiued of) wee muſt ſearch into the nature of that crooked,<note place="margin">What hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is, viz.</note> ſelfe-couering and ſelfe-couſening vice of hypocriſie, about which wee neede not goe farre, but alone turne our thoughts to the Apoſtles deſcription of it,<note place="margin">2.

                        <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a forme of godlineſſe, without the power thereof. It a falſe fained goodnes, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alone painted, and put on, and counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In plaine words thus you may deſcribe it; A corruption of the will,<note place="margin">A corruption of the will, inclining it ſelfe to doe ſome good, &amp; leaue ſome euill for ones owne ſake.</note> whereby it inclineth it ſelfe to ſeeme good, by doing ſome good, and leauing ſome euill for ones owne ſake. For euery man is naturally deſirous to haue other men eſteeme him good, and to eſteeme of himſelfe alſo, as of one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20394:12"/>that is good; and becauſe, neither will his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours conceiue ſo of him, neither can hee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of himſelfe, without ſome ground for ſuch conceit; he is therefore willing to doe ſomething that may worke in others, and in himſelfe ſuch an opinion of him, and to auoyde ſome other things, that might procure the contrary opinion. Yea, euery man naturally is willing to be happy, and willing to think, that he ſhall be happy, yet becauſe this thought cannot be maintained, without ſome colour of reaſon, hee is alſo willing to doe ſome things, that he may thinke will further his happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and auoyde ſome other things that will hinder it. Now when a man that liueth in the Church, out of theſe naturall deſires, that are inſeparably vnited to his reaſonableneſſe, doth incline himſelfe in ſome things, to yeeld to the Doctrine of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that ſo he may ſerue his owne turne, in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his owne deſires: this is falſe goodneſſe, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alone to the eye; it is called goodneſſe, as a falſe ſhilling is called a ſhilling, becauſe it looketh like a ſhilling, hauing the ſame ſtampe, and a little filuer at top, though in ths middeſt it be nothing but braſſe, or ſome ſuch baſe and vnworthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If a man (I ſay) be moued for his owne credit or eaſe ſake, yea, or for his owne faluation ſake, to be willing to do ſome good, that God in his word commandeth; and to forbeare ſome euill in the ſame Word condemned, and not to be willing to doe all good commanded, and auoyde all euill forbidden; this is but guilefull hollow, imperfect. diſſembled goodneſſe, ſo eſteemed by men, and ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20394:13"/>appearing to them, that can looke alone vpon the bark and outer rinde of things, not ſo appearing to the pure eyes of God, nor ſo accounted in his true iudgement, that ſearcheth into the marrow, and pith, and depth of all things. For God himſelfe is the chiefe good, and in a manner the onely good, neither is any thing good, but by participation from him; and ſo that goodneſſe which is not (as it were) deriued from him, as from the originall of it, nor directed to him, as to the ſcope and end of it, becauſe it hath nothing to doe with him, therefore indeede is not goodneſſe, whatſoeuer ſhew it may carrie to the world. So that as true goodneſſe, is will to bee good in all things for Gods ſake; ſo is falſe goodneſſe a will to ſeeme good in ſome things for ones owne ſake. Eaſe may moue a man to doe ſome good, and auoyde ſome euill, ſo may credit, ſo may profit. Now if any of theſe things doe chiefly and principally worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our wills, as the motiues and ends of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then is that goodneſſe but hypocriſie and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming goodneſſe; and that man who liuing in the viſible Church, ſuffers this vice (of being induced but to ſome good things, not all; and withdrawne but from ſome euill (not all) for his owne credite, profit, eaſe, or the like cauſe, not Gods ſake onely or principally) to ſway and beare rule in him, he is an hypocrite.<note place="margin">Hypocriſie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth where it is not ſeene and lamented.</note> But when and in whom doth this vice preuaile? may ſome man ſay, I anſwere; euen then, and in that man, where and in whom it is not ſeene, oppoſed &amp; reſiſted by the ſpirituall weapons of frequent confeſſions, hearty petitions, earneſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20394:13"/>and diligent application of the word of God againſt it for to beate it downe: for all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be diſtinguiſhed into two kindes: ſome are more fleſhly and groſſe (as I may terme them) that doe follow the temperature of the body, and their ſtrength and weakeneſſe doth much what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the conſtitution thereof: ſuch are wrath and choller, gluttony and filthineſſe, and diuers other like. Now it is not of neceſſitie, that theſe vices bee actually in all the corrupt generation of <hi>Adam;</hi> alone they are in euerie one (as I may terme it) virtually, ſo that if the ſame ſoule were put into another body, whoſe temperature would fit the turne of thoſe vices, it would be as plentifull in them, as any other man is, or as it ſelfe is in any other vice. Now there are other vices of a more ſpirituall nature (as I may terme it), I meane more immediatly and principally flowing from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of reaſon and of will, and from the natiue defilement of the ſoule, in its chiefe faculties; ſuch as are pride, vnbeliefe, forgetfulneſſe of GOD, vnconſcionableneſſe, and by name, this hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And theſe laſt kind of vices are in all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſince the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom all became dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes; though it muſt not bee denyed, that in ſome they grow more head-ſtrong, than in others; and doe more manifeſtly and violently ſhew themſelues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are more or leſſe nouriſhed with meanes and occaſions, and (as it were) ſoyled with helpes and opportunities fit for them. And as for all theſe vices, there doe they preuayle, and there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20394:14"/>they muſt be called predominant, where they are not obſerued, bewailed, acknowledged, oppugned, and that by ſpirituall weapons, and that conſtantly. For it is moſt vndeniable, that wherſoeuer any vice is, there it ruleth, vnleſſe it be mortified and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit: that is, by ſpirituall means and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, faithfully vſed, wherewith Gods Spirit faileth not to worke; and it is as certaine, that this grand member, or lim rather, of the body of death, which we all bring into the world with vs (I mean) hypocriſie is in euery man; wherefore it hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in him, vnleſſe it be, as was formerly ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diſcerned and oppugned. And therefore alſo it is great reaſon, that ſuch one ſhould receiue his name from hypocriſie; &amp; be intituled an hypocrite. And ſo I would think,<note place="margin">An hypocrite is a profeſſor of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that doth not ſee and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</note> an hypocrite maybe fitly called a profeſſor of religion, that doth not ſee, bewaile, and fight againſt his owne hypocriſie, that is, his aptnes to make a ſhew of goodnes, by doing onely ſome things that are commanded, and auoyding onely ſome things that are forbidden for his owne ſake, not indeuouring to doe, and auoyd all ſuch things for Gods ſake.<note place="margin">Not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but the not oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, makes an hypocrite.</note> And this thing is worthy to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marked, that I ſpake of the predominancie of vice, becauſe it is of maruellous great vſe, for the true triall of our felues, according to thoſe things that afterwards ſhall be ſet downe for that purpoſe. For not euery one that feeleth in himſelfe ſome of theſe ſignes, and effects of hypocriſie, that ſhall be named, is by and by an hypocrite: but he that hath them in him, and takes no care to find them out: or if hee muſt needes find them out, continueth not to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20394:14"/>make warre againſt them by prayers, and teares, &amp; the ſword of the ſpirit, and the like weapons of our Chriſtian warfare. And of the deſcription of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite hitherto. I goe forwards to ſhew you the ſorts or kinds of hypocrites: for well may wee ſay, that a notable difference in degrees, may giue iuſt occaſion of diſtributing the things ſo differing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers kinds, as the Scripture diuideth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Bodies into the greater light for the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND of hypocrites within the Church,<note place="margin">Of hypocrites there are two kinds, the groſſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and the cloſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</note> we ſhal find two kinds; the greater hypocrite, &amp; the leſſer hypocrite: the groſſe hypocrite &amp; the cloſe hypocrite; both well called hypocrites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in both, that vice preuayleth; and yet the one diſtinguiſhed from the other by the names of greater and leſſer, or groſſer andleſſe groſſe, becauſe the degree of preuailing in one; is farre higher and fuller than in the other. As euen of Leapers, ſome were not ſo much leprous as others; though both leapers &amp; vncured. And of diſeaſes, ſome are more vehement than others, though both mortall? And of wounds, ſome are deeper and broader than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, though both deadly.</p>
                     <p>Now a groſſe hypocrite is he, in whom hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20394:15"/>ſo farre preuaileth,<note place="margin">The groſs hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is he, that knowes himſelfe but to diſſemble, and yet cares not for it.</note> that he knowes himſelfe but to make a ſhew of goodneſſe, for ſome ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and yet cares not for it, out of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtory-hardneſſe of his heart. This hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hides himſelfe from the world, but not from himſelfe; he couſens others, but himſelfe doth not deceiue himſelfe: for hee is full well acquainted with his owne intentions, and perfectly priuy to the windings of his behauiour; in very deed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, euen ſmiling to thinke, how he beguiles the world with a certaine fineneſſe of outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſeeming. Many a man maketh a ſhew to be religious, by doing diuers good things, in the meane ſpace knowing full well, that he doth not in heart regard any of theſe things, but alone that hee thinkes it fit ſo to wooe the times, or to fiſh for the fauour of ſome particular man, or to compaſſe ſome or other of his owne earthly, and ſelf-reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proiects. Many a pariſhioner commeth to Church vſually each Sabbath, and receiueth the Sacrament commonly when his neighbours doe, who doth in his heart no more eſteeme of Church nor Sacraments than a very Pagan; and ſo much hee doth know by himſelfe too, and yet is neuer touched with any remorſe of heart, for his ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and to-himſelfe-euident diſſembling. Yea, it is to be feared, that many a Diuine ſtudies hard, preacheth (not learnedly alone, but) holily (too for matter and words); and yet in his owne ſoule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more account of preaching, than of a play-booke, but that hee ſeeketh by this meanes to liue in the world, and to attayne a Benefice. Many
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20394:15"/>a ſonne and ſeruant of a godly father or maſter, will hearken diligently at Sermon, and bring home (by memorie of writing) all the ſubſtance of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; yea, and be diligent at prayers in the family, and perhaps alſo pray himſelf, with very good and commendable petitions and words; when as all this while he is guiltie to himſelfe, of making no reckoning of any goodneſſe; and in truth careth for, nor thinketh of any thing elſe, but winning the fauour of his parent or maſter, or credit and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with thoſe amongſt whom hee liueth: and yet his ſoule is no more moued with ſorrow, for this his moſt groſſe guile, then if he were the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hearted perſon vnder heauen. For in truth, of all ſinnes in the world, nothing doth bring a greater extremitie of deadneſſe, and ſenſeleſneſſe vpon the ſoule, then this abominable hollowneſſe, when it preuaileth in this degree, that now I am intreating of. Such hypocrites as theſe were <hi>Abſolon</hi> and <hi>Achitophel.</hi> Did not <hi>Abſolon</hi> know, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the religion of a vow? Did not <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> know, that he made nothing of Gods houſe and the ſacrifices: but (euen as a ſtaule) the better to attaine the fauour of <hi>Douid,</hi> and his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement? Doubtleſſe they were well enough ſeene in their owne purpoſes and proiects, and could not but confeſſe at the barre of their owne conſcience (but that they would not conſider of it), that in very truth they did but ſerue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (and not God) in all their ſeeming religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Such hypocrytes alſo were the greater number of the Phariſies, which made our Sauiour
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20394:16"/>Chriſt, ſo tart and earneſt againſt them at all times; for well did hee ſee, that they did all their good workes to be ſeene of men; and that their formes of pietie and godlineſſe were meere paintings, and that they regarded nothing, but to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great in the earth, and euen vnder colour of long praying, ſought onely to deuoure widowes houſes.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.15.16</note> Such alſo were thoſe Preachers, of whom the Apoſtle affirmeth, that they did teach Chriſt not purely, but of contention, as it were to put downe <hi>Paul,</hi> and to winne the Garland from him, and ſo to adde affliction to his bands. And theſe be groſſe hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>Now there are a ſort of diſſemblers,<note place="margin">The cloſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, is hee which is an hypocrite, and yet doth think himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note> not ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nor ſo groſſe as theſe, and yet ſtill vnder the power and dominion of guile; who thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee true Chriſtians, and make account, that they haue that religion and piety, which they ſeeme to haue, and yet in very truth haue it not; but (as S.<note place="margin">Iames 1.22:</note> 
                        <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh) deceiue their owne ſelues, as well as others, though the worſt for them is, they cannot deceiue God. There are a number of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion in the Church, of whom all that know them, haue a very good opinion: ſuppoſing them to be moſt worthy Chriſtians; yea, which in their owne hearts doe verily thinke of themſelues, that they bee indeede the ſonnes and daughters of God, and that they ſerue him, and not themſelues; when as in very deede, they doe nothing elſe but couſen themſelues, and the whole world; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they alſo are very rottenneſſe, and ſerue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alone, and not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Such
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20394:16"/>an hypocrite was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who was ſtrict in all the Legall obſeruations,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.6.</note> and vnrebukeable before men,<note place="margin">Acts 22.3.</note> and zealous of the Law, and (as he thought) earneſt for the God of his fathers; yea,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.9.</note> who was aliue before the Law came (in his owne eſteeme) and made full account to goe to heauen; and yet for all that, hee was but a whited tombe, and a rotten carkaſſe; a Iew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out before men, not within before God, as himſelfe afterwards did know, how (euen by experience of his owne caſe) to diſtinguiſh.</p>
                     <p>Now if any man demand,<note place="margin">The cloſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe vpright alone out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or for want of ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into himſelfe.</note> how it ſhould be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man ſo farre to beguile himſelfe, as to thinke, that he hath that vertue indeede, which he hath alone in ſhew? The anſwere is; that children and fooles, will eaſily take a guilded copper ring, for a ring of gold; and ſo blindneſſe and want of vnderſtanding is the cauſe, that many men doe ſo farre miſ-take themſelues. And againe, the anſwer is, that many a man thinkes himſelfe a great ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, whoſe learning yet doth nothing excell his neighbours: becauſe hee compareth himſelfe with himſelfe, and doth not prooue himſelfe by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of learning, and by comparing himſelfe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and ſo, many a man eſteemes his eſtate to be very good, when indeed hee is a plaine banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rout, and oweth more than he is worth; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is ſlacke and careleſſe in caſting vp his reckonings: euen ſo the cloſe hypocrite is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and yet knowes it not; becauſe out of his aboundant ſelfe-loue (which makes him giue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie way to a good perſwaſion of himſelfe), hee is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20394:17"/>loath to beſtow paines, in ſearching and examining his owne heart. Would a man bee frequent and carefull in trying himſelfe; he could not be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and not know it? but often a thing lies hid, for want of due ſeeking, that with a little carefull ſearching, would ſoone be brought to light. So hypocriſie ruleth, and yet is not perceiued to rule, becauſe men will not enquire much after it; and the nature of it is, to be craftie in hiding it ſelfe. And theſe be the two moſt remarkable ſorts of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, whereof yet it muſt be conſidered, that there is a great difference to be made.</p>
                     <p>The groſſe hypocrite is to God,<note place="margin">The groſſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is as loathſome to God, as the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinner, not ſo the cloſer hypocrite.</note> the moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all the ſonnes of men: no kind of ſinners are more loathſome to God, than thoſe that ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wittingly to ſerue their owne turnes with a bare ſhew of religion, when in their hearts they do quite and cleane neglect it. Theſe men are more grieuouſly to be puniſhed, than any the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and infamous ſinners amongeſt men. A thiefe, an whore, a murderer, a witch, ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a more bitter damnation, than this moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable diſſembler: for hee doth moſt extreamely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe and diſhonour God, and his moſt ſacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, dallying and mocking with him to his face, and euen ſcorning and deriding him to his teeth (as men vſe to ſpeake) and trampling vnder feete the richeſt and faireſt of all his pretious treaſures of goodneſſe. But it is not ſo with the cloſe or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer hypocrite, that is an hypocrite, and knowes it not: he is not ſo bad either in Gods account, or in the account of wiſemen, as the notorious and open
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20394:17"/>offender, neither ſhall his caſe be ſo hard, as the caſe of ſuch vile wretches, becauſe his ſinne is leſſe wilful, and therefore alſo leſſe odious in Gods eies.</p>
                     <p>And from this difference it commeth to paſſe, that the groſſe hypocrite is ſo ſeldome conuerted, as a man may well make a queſtion, Whether any man, hauing any while continued in ſuch palpable diſſembling, were euer truly turned yea or no. But the cloſe hypocrite many times becomes true hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: many a man (being by education, or by caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all falling into ſome good family, brought alone to a forme of pietie, and yet not wilfully ſetting himſelfe to be guilefull) is after ſome time truely ſanctified, and becommeth vpright-hearted before the Lord.<note place="margin">A cloſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite by the growth of his hypocriſie, may ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a groſſe hypocrite.</note> But a cloſe hypocrite hardning himſelf againſt the Word often, will at the laſt become a groſſe hypocrite, looſing euen theſe ſhadowes of goodneſſe, which at firſt he had, and wherewith he did for a time beguile his owne ſoule. <hi>Iudas</hi> (in all likelihood) was at firſt a cloſe hypocrite, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe to diſſemble, nor of purpoſe making a ſhew to reſpect Chriſt for hope of future aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by him (in his heart meane while making no more account of him, than of another man), but becauſe he hardned himſelfe in his ſinne of theft and couetouſneſſe, at length hypocriſie grew ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in him, and hee became as palpable a diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler as euer was, when hee durſt betray his Maſter (that Sonne of man) with a kiſſe. For ſinne will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily grow from a ſmaller quantity to a greater, and from leſſer degrees to more fulneſſe and largeneſſe. And this diſtinction of hypocrites into two kindes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20394:18"/>is of ſingular vſe in the examination of our ſelues, and ſerueth excellently to diſcouer men vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which elſe would eaſily thinke too well of themſelues. Many a man, becauſe he knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be none of thoſe, that do wittingly play the hypocrites, therefore imagineth, that the name of hypocrite ſhould not be giuen to him: but now the knowledge of this difference, muſt make vs more wary ouer our owne hearts, and ſtirre vs vp to take heed, leſt happily wee be found in the latter kinde, though not in the former: for the truth is, neither of them both can be ſaued, vnleſſe they reforme themſelues.</p>

I now come to ſet downe certaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall notes of difference betwixt the true-hearted, and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. Theſe are very many; I will inſiſt alone vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon foure, which to me ſeeme the moſt euident and eaſily-diſcerned.<note place="margin">An hypocrite is moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with other mens ſinnes, the vpright hearted with his owne.</note> Firſt, the hypocrite is a great find-fault abroad, a little find-fault at home. Many things (almoſt all things) are out of order in his neighbours; in him, little or nothing is amiſſe, if you will take his owne iudgement. Yea, the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20394:18"/>faults of others, he knowes how, euen skilfully to aggranate; his owne greater faults, he wanteth neither will nor wit to extenuate: ſo that in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or ſpeaking of his brethren, and thoſe that liue with him, and about him, he can diſcouer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers great and ſtrange enormities, and is much troubled at them; in thinking or ſpeaking of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, all things are well, and in very good order, at leaſt not ſo farre amiſſe, as to procure any great trouble or diſquietment to him. Other ſinnes and wrongs (for thoſe ſinnes pinch hardeſt that ſeeme wrongfull) make the hypocrite often euen weary of his life: but ſeldome doe his owne ſinnes ſo much perplexe him; vnleſſe in the agony of bitter tentation, as it fared with <hi>Iudas,</hi> when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and hee fell out. This note our Sauiour Chriſt doth point vs to, when hee bringeth in the hypocrite ſpeaking to his brother in this wiſe,<note place="margin">Match. 7.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Let me pull the moath out of thine eye,</hi> when in the meane ſpace hee felt not the beame in his owne eyes. A good man can ſee a moath abroad, but not with the neglect of a beame at home: but the hypocrite will make a great ſtirre about a ſmall matter in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; in himſelfe the greateſt are ſleightly paſſed ouer. But how now the true-hearted? euen quite contrary: the faults of others do leſſe trouble him, than his owne; and hee can farre rather excuſe and defend them than himſelfe. Yea, hee hath more to ſay againſt himſelfe before God in ſecret, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the world beſides in publique; and he will rather paſſe by a ſinne any where, than in his owne breaſt and life. He followes Chriſts counſell, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20394:19"/>pulls out the beame firſt, that afterwards hee may ſee to pull out the moath. Thus, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt himſelfe and his owne ſinnes, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelfe as the leaſt of all Saints, and the greateſt of all ſinners; this was after his conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for before he would haue had him by the eares, that ſhould haue ſo intituled him. And indeede it muſt needs be ſo, both with the hypocrite, and the vpright, as hath beene ſpoken: for the hypocrite is deſtitute of the loue of God, and moued onely by ſelfe-loue, euen to that little goodneſſe he ſeemeth to haue. Now loue (we know) is a blinding paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will not ſuffer a man to diſcerne the faults of him, whom he loueth: but the true Chriſtian is endued with the loue of God, and out of that loue embraceth the courſes of pietie: but for himſelfe, he is bleſſed with that excellent grace, of loathing and abhorring himſelfe in duſt and aſhes, out of the knowledge he hath of his owne corrupt and ſinfull nature. And from this hatred it cannot but follow, that he will prooue a ſeuere cenſurer of himſelfe; for hatred doth whet on the wit to ſpie faults, and to amplifie them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">An hypocrite is confident of himſelfe.</note> an hypocrite is alwayes confident of himſelfe, &amp; of his own power, not to be ouertaken, at leaſt, of ſuch &amp; ſuch great ſins, which (perhaps) he neuer yet hath committed; yea, he thinks alwayes, and often brags, that all the world ſhould not draw him to do ſuch abominations: and from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of himſelfe it comes, that hee is ſo bitter and pittileſſe, in ſpeaking againſt others that haue offended; and alſo, that he is of himſelfe ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20394:19"/>ventrous, and ſo ready to ruſh vpon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of euill, for that he miſdoubteth not himſelfe, but imagineth that he ſhall certainely doe well for all that. And in the maine matter, hee is moſt of all confident, likely neuer ſo much as ſuſpecting (becauſe he will not ſuſpect) himſelfe to be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite (vnleſſe it be in ſome heauy croſſe or tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but ſtill ſleepeth quietly in a ſecure opinion of his owne vprightneſſe, and being ſure GODS child. So was <hi>Paul</hi> once aliue without the Law: ſo the Iewes with whom Chriſt talketh, boldly did affirme, euen (ſay Chriſt what he could to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) that they had God for their Father,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.41.</note> though he aſſured them, they were of their father the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell; and therefore we may be ſure, they were at beſt but hypocrites. But now,<note place="margin">The true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is fearfull of himſelfe.</note> the true Chriſtian is iealous of himſelfe, leſt he alſo ſhould be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and out of this doubting of his owne ſtrength, withdrawes himſelfe from the occaſions of euill, leſt that (afore he were aware) be ſhould be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them; yea, he is ſomewhat fearefull ofen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of his owne eſtate, whether hee be a true Chriſtian yea or no; meeting with ſo much falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſo many fruites of guile, that often hee ſtands amazed at himſelfe, and is faine to call the matter into queſtion with himſelfe, and to diſcuſſe it much and hard, afore hee can ſettle his minde in that aſſured perſwaſion of himſelfe, that hee is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Thus the one (not fearing himſelfe) takes all for granted, that he thinkes true of himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proouing; the other (out of much feare) is much in proouing himſelfe, and will not beleeue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20394:20"/>any thing, without proofe.</p>
                     <p>A third note of difference is this,<note place="margin">Iames 1.8. An hypocrite is changeable as occaſion ſerueth, a true Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> the hypocrite is (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes) variable in all his wayes, wauering off &amp; on, differing according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time, place, company, and the like, if hee be put to it. So in perſecution hee falls off: when wealth and honour comes in, to draw him another way, he is gone; he is not ſtill ſutable to himſelfe. When piece is fauoured, hee is for it; at other times, when it is out of countenance, he is at beſt a newter, perhaps againſt it. In places where good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is in good requeſt, he is good; elſewhere hee alters himſelfe, and giues himſelfe leaue to ceaſe being good; and for company, he is moſt times as the company; and in truth is a man ſo apt to turne, that (vnleſſe he chance to be of a ſowre, or a teſtie nature) he is for all companies. He is not the ſame prinately, that publiquely; betwixt God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that before others; at home and abroad; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed ſtriueth to be. But the true Chriſtian, he is fixed and conſtant, alwayes the ſame, rooted, grounded, eſtabliſhed, and doth not giue himſelfe ouer to changes and alteration. I eonfeſſe, he alſo findeth it much harder to be good in ſome times, than in ſome; and in ſome places and companies, than in others. The diuell failes not to take the aduantages of time, place, company, and to preſſe more hard vpon him to doe euill, when hee hath theſe opportunities ſtanding fauourably-for euill-doing; and likewiſe to pull him backeward (with more violence of tempting) from God, when theſe things ſtand croſſe to goodneſſe; yea, his corrupt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20394:20"/>nature is capable enough of the helpes to euill, and hindrances from good, which change of place and company doe bring with them. Yea, ſometimes alterations in theſe things, may euen adaunt him for a while, and according as they finde him wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, make him now and then ſtart backe from ſome good deed, or ruſh forward into ſome euill: but ſtill hee would not alter, hee is aſhamed that hee finds himſelfe ſomewhat altered, and he returneth in concluſion to be the ſame, notwithſtanding the variation of theſe circumſtances. A Compaſſe Needlewell touched with the Adamant, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be turning Northward; and though with ſhaking it may for a time be pulld backward, yet it returnes againe (after a little ſtanding ſetledly) to the old point, and (as ſoone as euer it can be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to follow its owne inclination) it trembles and hangs Northward: ſo whatſoeuer change of things befall, a true Chriſtian hangs in his deſires to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and if the vehemence of a tentation, through feare or hope, do ſhake him off a litle, yet he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turnes to God-ward againe, and is neuer well, till hee haue returned to the poynt of obedience. Not ſo the hypocrite; for hee (becauſe he is not good for Gods ſake, but his owne) if matters come to that paſſe, by occaſion of changes, in time, place and company, that goodneſſe may be an hurt to him, or badneſſe a benefit, or no hurt; is wholly ſweyed by reſpect of himſelfe, and takes leaue to himſelfe, to pleaſe himſelfe in his ſo changing. The one is chaffe, the other a tree; ſo mainly they differ.</p>

                     <p> Laſt of all,<note place="margin">An hypocrite is moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the outſide, a true Chriſtian with the inſide. Matth. 23.25.</note> the hypocrite (as Chriſt chargeth the Phariſies) are ſtill making cleane the outſide of the Cup and Platter, not regarding though the inſide be full of rauening and couetouſnes. Chriſts mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is plaine enough, That diſſemblers looke alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to their outward or open actions and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; not regarding the thoughts and corruptions of their hearts. All their care is, that they may not bee knowne to doe euill: but the cloſer diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their inward man, they can eaſily beare withall; it little vexeth them to find, what euill ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and ſinfull inclinations they haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But the true Chriſtian (according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that God doth giue to Ieruſalem by <hi>Ieremiah</hi>) is carefull to waſh his heart,<note place="margin">Ierem. 4.14.</note> and to make his inſide cleane, and not his outſide onely. He laboureth to keepe his hand and tongue vnſpotted of the world; and if any blot cleaue to him, he is diligent to waſh it off by humiliation: but he is alſo carefull to keep his ſoule pure from the hidden cogitations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations after euill. And if heere it fall out, that he gather any filth, hee ſcoureth the inſide with as much diligence, as the Phariſie vſed to doe his hands. So then the hypocrite hath little to doe with his heart: the euills thereof doe not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him, hee takes ſmall paines to reſiſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſecret and darke diſorders of his ſoule. But the true Chriſtian findeth himſelfe to haue a world of labour within: hee is much vexed with theſe heart-euils, and hath farre more to doe in the inward roomes of his ſoule, than in the outer court of his conuerſation. An hypocrite (like a ſlothfull
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20394:21"/>or ſluttiſh ſeruant) leaues the nookes and corners vnſwept, and vncleanſed; the true Chriſtian, (as a true louer of cleanneſſe) is carefull to ranſacke, and purge euery corner of his ſoule: ſo you haue the generall differences betwixt the fruitfull and the drie branch. But the heart will eaſily put off theſe generalities; and therefore moſt hypocrites will not find themſelues by theſe notes: for nothing is more common with our deceitfull ſpirits, than when ſuch generall notes are giuen, to make our ſelues beleeue, that all is well with vs, though all be out of order. I will therefore proceede to a more particular diſcouery of the hypocrite, by ſhewing how he agrees with the vpright (and yet ſtill dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from him) in the foure chiefe and principall graces, wherein he oftentimes doth thinke himſelfe as abundant as his betters: but now I will ſo plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay open his failings, that hee ſhall no longer miſtake (with ſo wide miſtakings) vnleſſe hee will adde wilfulneſſe to his error.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20394:22"/>Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, good Conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or obedience. In each of theſe, the hypocrite doth ſomewhat reſemble the true Chriſtian, and yet in each the diſſimilitude is as true &amp; euident, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt gilded copper and pure gold.<note place="margin">An hypocrite may be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in knowledge as a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and more than many a true Chriſtian.</note> Let vs ſee the ſimilitude and diſſimilitude in Knowledge: Now it cannot be denyed, but that the falſe-hearted man may conceiue as many diuine truths in his mind, as the trueſt Chriſtian that is; yea, many times it falls out, that the knowledge of the hypocrite doth in quantity much exceed that of the true Chriſtian. Who can doubt, but that the Phariſies were better ſeene in the Law, and in all points of Diuinity, than the poore blind man? yet he was true; they hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. An hypocrite may haue a better wit, a better memory, a quicker conceit than the vpright: hee may haue better education, more means, more tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching than the vpright; &amp; conſequently may much excell him in knowledge. Nay, no doubt, but that a very diſſembler may be ſo abundant in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Word of God, that he may be able to diſcourſe and talke admirably, of any truth in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie: yea, to make a moſt excellent prayer, with exceeding good words, and exceeding good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and alſo to preach the Word moſt plauſibly, and moſt fruitfully, ſo as to gaine to himſelfe the name and eſtimation of a worthie and a godly preacher too. Who can make any doubt, but that <hi>Iudas</hi> did preach, and preach very worthily? and is it not manifeſt, that there ſhall be ſome, who will pleade prophecying, and caſting out diuels in the name of Chriſt? who muſt yet bee reiected with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20394:22"/>this grieuous (and yet righteous) anſwere, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquitie.</hi> Did not diuers alſo preach Chriſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> not ſincerely, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? yea, and that ſo, as the Apoſtle reioyced in their preaching? Wherefore it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their preaching was ſound and orthodoxe for the matter of it, and alſo fruitfull and profitable, for the euent of it: for elſe it could not haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the Apoſtles reioycing. You ſee then moſt euidently, that a very diſſembler may haue ſo much knowledge, as to be a commendable and profitable Miniſter of the Goſpel; when many a man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is ſincere and ſound in their very ſoules, may come farre ſhort of the twentieth part of that knowledge.</p>
                     <p>But where then is the difference of the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of the vnſanctified knowledge, ſeeing in matter and degree it may be the ſame in both true and falſe perſons? I anſwere: In two things;<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth ſwell him, of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him. 1. Cor. 8.1.2.</note> in the effect, and in the extent. Firſt, for the effect: the hypocrite is puffed vp with his knowledge; it ſwells him, and makes him bigge with conceit of himſelfe, and diſdaine of others. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is plaine in that point; <hi>knowledge</hi> (meaning it of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified knowledge, ſuch as is that of hypocrites) <hi>puffeth vp.</hi> And againe;<note place="margin">Iohn 7.49.</note> 
                        <hi>If any man thinke that hee knoweth any thing</hi> (that is, be conceited of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge), <hi>hee knowes nothing as hee ought to doe.</hi> You may ſee this point apparantly in the Phariſies; <hi>This ignorant people that know not the Law are curſed.</hi> And againe; <hi>Thou art altogether borne in ſinne, and doeſt thou teach vs?</hi> Loe how the vnderſtanding of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20394:23"/>doth make them inſult ouer others, whom they thinke to vnderſtand leſſe than themſelues; how it fills them as with conceit of themſelues, ſo with contempt of others, as it were ſimple fellowes, and very punies, in compariſon of them. For why? the hypocrite knowes onely to talke, not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: hee makes his knowledge a rule for his tongue and lippes in diſcourſe, not for his life and deeds in conuerſation: hee neuer vſeth his inſight into the Law, to examine himſelfe thereby; and to marke, how farre ſhort his practice commeth of his knowledge: but alone imployes it (if neede be) to diſcourſe, to teach others, and reprooue others. Hence it comes, that his knowledge doth heaue him vp, and like meate ill-digeſted, begets the wind of ſelfe-conceitedneſſe; becauſe he will needes imagine himſelfe ſo much the better, by how much he conceiueth more things, and can diſcourſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for he with his knowledge will lay heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vpon others, but himſelfe will not touch them with one finger; that is, hee is a great exactor of duty from others, and here hee ſtraineth himſelfe to the vtmoſt; but he takes leaue to himſelfe to be careleſſe enough of doing after his knowledge, as a man that holdeth a lant-horne in his hand before others to guide them right, himſelfe not heeding the light that is in his owne hand, nor caring where he ſets his foote. But how now the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? Why he, the more he knowes, the more hee diſcerneth how ſhort he comes of his dutie, and ſo is hee the more meane in his owne eyes, and the more humble, and the more ready to learne of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20394:23"/>and to take directions from them. His vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth depreſſe him, rather than exalt him in his owne conceite, becauſe hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it as a ſtraite rule, to diſcouer to himſelfe the crookedneſſe of his owne actions, and to make himſelfe ſee his owne exceeding great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiueneſſe in thoſe things, wherein hee ought to bee farre more plentifull and forward. The neerer his knowledge comes to perfection (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee vſeth his knowledge as a Lant-horne to his feete, and a light to his paths), the more hee perceiueth how farre ſhort himſelfe commeth of perfection; for as hee knowes much, ſo is hee euer calling vpon himſelfe to doe what he knowes, and falling out with himſelfe, for not ſtriuing to doe more, ſeeing God hath pleaſed to make him vnderſtand ſo much. You may ſee this moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> there was not in all the earth (whileſt hee liued) a man of a larger heart, more richly and plentifully adorned with the knowledge of all the myſteries of godlineſſe, and of a more deepe vnderſtanding in things diuine; and yet there did not walke on the face of the earth, a more humble man, a more meane in his owne eyes, more willing and ready to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to all baſeneſſe, to beare any thing, and endure any thing, and to bee made and accounted as the refuſe of the world, as an abiect, of no reputation. To conclude therefore, the knowledge of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth ſwell his heart, and lift him vp with conceit of himſelfe; the knowledge of the vpright doth abate the conceit of himſelfe, and makes him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20394:24"/>viler and viler in his owne eyes: and this is a moſt ſenſible difference. The true Chriſtian, the more hee knowes, the more ready hee is to learne of any man, out of his humbleneſſe; for he knowes as well the imperfection of his knowledge, as any other thing. The falſe Chriſtian, if hee haue any more than common quantitie of knowledge, doth euen almoſt ſcorne to learne of any body, becauſe hee ſtill conceiueth his knowledge to bee more than it is.</p>
                     <p>Further,<note place="margin">The hypocrite will winke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome truths: the true Chriſtian is ready to yeeld to euery truth.</note> for the extent of knowledge, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is cleare; the hypocrite for all his large know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, great learning, quicke-ſightedneſſe, is yet almoſt alwayes wittingly ignorant of ſome one or other duty, ſinne or truth, that he might know, if hee would but vſe his eyes to looke about him. It may be euer ſaid of him in ſome, or other point, as it is ſaid of them in <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.5.</note> 
                        <hi>This they know not, and that willingly.</hi> What duty for feare of loſſe, diſgrace, or the like inconuenience he hath no wil to performe; that he will not ſee to be a duty, leſt his conſcience ſhould checke him, for not performing it. And ſome fault, that hee doth not reſolue to leaue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is profitable, delightfull, or otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall; that, he cannot perceiue to be a fault, that he may not bee inforced to fault himſelfe for not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it. In what truths it would bee againſt his credit (as he ſuppoſeth) to change his opinion, thoſe he will not ſee to be truths, though hee doe ſee them:<note place="margin">Matth. 13.15.</note> yea, hee winketh with his eyes (as the Scripture ſpeaketh of the Iewes and Phariſies) and will make a ſhift not to know in the very ſun-ſhine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20394:24"/>of cleareſt light, in ſuch points. The Phariſies ſaw enough to perſwade them, that Chriſt Ieſus, the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the true Meſſiah:<note place="margin">Rom. 1 18.</note> but yet they could not be perſwaded of it, they would not yeeld vnto it, and they could not ſee it at length, becauſe they would not confeſſe it. This is to detaine the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe, a plaine fruit of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, when the light beateth vpon a mans ſoule, and hee beginnes to be conuinced, and to thinke within himſelfe, ſure this is a truth; yet becauſe the following of that truth would make againſt his commoditie, or his credit, or ſome other carnall deſire of his, therefore hee will caſt about againe, and ſet his wit vpon the tenters, and neuer giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer plodding, till he haue met with ſome tricke or other that may delude himſelfe, and hide the truth from his eyes, and (if it may be alſo) from the eies of others. This is, in ſeeing, not to ſee, and to hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke ones owne ſelfe; yea, to giue ones ſelfe ouer to the God of this world, to haue his eyes blinded by him; and ſo blinde will the hypocrite be for all his knowledge, making himſelfe alſo, as Chriſt tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Phariſies, a blind leader of the blinde. But the vpright-hearted man is quite contrarily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; He is willing, deſirous, ready, to know all that God teacheth, and to ſee all that the Lord reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto him. If the light begin to ſhine vpon his eyes, he is carefull to open his eyes, and let in the light; for he knowes how harmefull it is, to turne day into night, by ſhutting the windowes (as it were) to ſtop out the ſun-ſhine. If the Lord pleaſe to offer the knowledge of any thing formerly not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20394:25"/>knowne vnto his conſcience, and he finde himſelfe beginning to be perſwaded, that this is doubtleſſe ſo or ſo, by ſuch proofes or reaſons out of the word of God: hee doth not ſtruggle and ſtriue againſt his owne thoughts, becauſe of inconueniences which he ſees will follow him, if he ſhould yeeld: but ſetting aſide all ſuch reſpects, and little accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any inconueniences, in compariſon of ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering vp the light of his owne ſoule, he reſolueth to be conuinced, what euer come of it, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelfe vnto God, and prayeth, and ſeeketh knowledge, and findeth it, as you ſee in <hi>Cornelius.</hi> A good man vſeth his knowledge to guide his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and therefore will yeeld to know that, that may make againſt him in diuers reſpects. An hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite ſuffers his affections to ouer-rule his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore will not know that, that may croſſe his affections; the one guides his foote by his eye, and hee will ſee any thing that is offered to his ſight; the other guides his eye by his foote, and if he can poſſibly make any ſhift, will not ſee what hee mindeth not to follow. How quickely was <hi>Peter,</hi> and (by him after) the godly Iewes, conuinced of the calling of the Gentiles? but how wilfully did the wicked Iewes (which were but hypocrites) reſiſt this truth, and forbid the Apoſtles to preach to the Gentiles? And thus wee haue ſhewed the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnlikeneſſe of the true and falſe-hearted in knowledge. Wee will now enquire, how they differ and agree in faith.</p>

This difference our Sauiour Chriſt noteth in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the grounds,<note place="margin">Marke 4.5.6.</note> when he tells vs that the ſeed in the ſtony ground had not much earth, and that therefore it withered. The hypocrite hearing the doctrine of the Goſpel, or being brought vp vnder it, taketh it vpon truſt, thinkes, ſure it is true, and (hauing a little light affoorded him from GOD in the reading or preaching of the Word,) thinkes ſure this muſt needes be from God, it cannot but be ſo, and there an end. A more diſtinct, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſerious conſideration of the things reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ſtandeth not vpon: hee doth not muſe and ponder much of the excellency, fruit, benefit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and heauen lineſſe of Gods word, and the ſeuerall parts thereof: but the Chriſtian, by much pondering vpon the Word, and by often reſoluing his faith into the truth, wiſedome, and power of God, who is the author of the Word, is faſt groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſtabliſhed in the faith. The true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ceaſeth not to make himſelfe feele the power of the Goſpell in himſelfe more and more, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hee is rooted in beleening; the hypocrite neglecteth the thus pondering and muſing of the Word, and taking experience of the efficacie of it in himſelfe; and ſo, ſoone withereth or is choaked vp. The houſe that hath a foundation will ſtand in ſtrong blaſts, the tree that is deepely rooted, will not eaſily be blowne vp, but want of roote and foundation cauſeth the houſe to tumble, and the tree to be blowne vp, This difference, though it be a certaine difference, yet is not ſo manifeſt, till
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20394:26"/>the dayes of tribulation come, or till ſome triall be made by ſome meanes. For often the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is much more moleſted with tentations of doubting about the truth of the Word (as the holy man was that ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.13.</note> 
                        <hi>I haue waſhed mine hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in vaine</hi>), than the hypocrite. For Satan knowing that the diſſembler doth but diſſemble (as no doubt hee can well enough tell where hee raigneth and ruleth) is not ſo buſie to diſquiet his thoughts; yea verily if he haue any doubtings, hee lets them goe as they came, becauſe he buildeth not his hopes and happineſſe vpon the truth of this doctrine. But the true Chriſtian, as hauing laid (as it were) the wager of all his bliſſe vpon the truth of the Goſpell, is exceedingly vexed and diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe doubting thoughts: euen abhorring himſelfe, and aſhamed of himſelfe, that in ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and excellent truths, he ſhould finde any apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to make any queſtion. And this alſo Satan perceiuing, doth ſtriue to moleſt him continually with ſuch doubtings, and with the ſtirring vp of many obiections, which he cannot tell which way better to anſwer, than by loathing them, and being much diſcontented at their riſing in him. So that I ſay, the ſtrength and firmeneſſe of the vpright perſons aſſent, aboue the diſſemblers, is not ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent till the day of triall: but then it moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſcouereth it ſelfe. For the one will by no meanes be turned from embracing and following the beleeued truth, becauſe hee beleeueth it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, being rooted in faith; the other quickely giues ouer following it, becauſe hee beleeued it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20394:27"/>faintly, hauing taken little paines to feele his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto it, with much ſtrength of aſſurance, got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by much continuance of meditation about it. Thus the windes and waues muſt ſhew where is a foundation to others; but he that is founded, may know that hee is founded, by the labour hee doth beſtow in digging deepe to lay the foundation; that is, in much muſing to reſolue himſelfe of the truth of the Word, by finding the powerfull ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it in himſelfe daily; and he that hath not a foundation, may (if he will) know that hee hath none, by his neglect of this labour and paines, to lay it in his ſoule: but faith doth apply as well as conſent. It is manifeſt, that our iuſtifying faith is a putting on of Chriſt Ieſus, an eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, a receiuing of him, that is, an applying of him to euery mans ſelfe: for how can either food nouriſh, or apparrell keepe warme, if it be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed? and how ſhould Chriſt profit a man, if hee be not made his owne?</p>
                     <p>Now the hypocrite alſo ſeemeth to apply the promiſe of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">The hypocrite doth apply the promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Chriſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as well as the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> and Chriſt, and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites offered therein, euen vnto himſelfe in ſpeciall, being ſtrongly conceited, that Chriſt is his Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and that God is his God, and that he doth reſt and ſtay himſelfe vpon God, and vpon Chriſt for his owne ſaluation; and this he doth ſometimes ſo violently, that hee thinketh himſelfe to make no doubt of his being ſaued, being in this matter alſo giuen ouer to a ſtrong deluſion, to beleeue a lye. Surely the ſtony ground could neuer haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reioycing as they did, if they had not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20394:27"/>themſelues of their owne particular welfare, and had not made full reckoning to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the benefits of that doctrine, which they did imbrace. And did not the Iewes in the eighth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> boaſt with great boaſting, that they had one Father, euen God? And can any man doubt, but that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> did at firſt perſwade themſelues, that they ſhould be ſaued by Chriſt as well as others? But let vs ſee the difference then, which ſtands in theſe things. The hypocrite,<note place="margin">The hypocrite ſo applies the promiſe, that he neglects to apply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements &amp; the threats: but the true chriſtian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently:</note> hee doth ouer-greedily feede vpon the promiſes (as a childe will doe on ſweet things, euen to ſurfeting; and (as you know) children are apt to eate their meate without bread): in the meane ſpace not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to apply to himſelfe the Commaundements for his direction, and the threats for his humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yea, the more forward he is in taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the promiſes by way of vſurpation, the leſſe carefull he is of taking the precepts and threats of the Word, and laying them cloſe to his ſoule alſo. Thus he maketh it manifeſt, that it is not the holy Ghoſt which doth inable him, to lay holde vpon the promiſes, and to reſt himſelfe vpon them: but that it is the preſumptuous boldneſſe of his owne ſelfe-loue, which maketh him forward, to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands vpon any thing, that hee thinketh is good for him, and to pull it to himſelfe (as it were) whether God will or no. But now the true hearted Chriſtian doth in the ſame degree, apply the other parts of the Word to himſelfe: that the promiſes of ſaluation, and Gods goodneſſe in Chriſt. Hee doth not ſeuer, what God would haue ioyned: but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20394:28"/>(becauſe it is the good Spirit of God, that frameth his heart to receiue Chriſt, and relie vpon him, therefore by the direction of the ſame Spirit, which muſt needs moue him to be of the ſame minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe things that are equally true, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God) he feedeth alſo vpon the ſowre herbs of the threats, to humble himſelfe as need requires, and ceaſeth not to vrge the precepts vpon himſelfe for his continuall direction. So the hypocrite ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth, what God would haue ioyned, picking out of the Word that, that likes him beſt, I meane the comfortable promiſes; and caſting the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde his backe. But the true Chriſtian ioyneth thoſe things together, that God would haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; making vſe of the whole Word to himſelfe, as well, as much, as carefully (in their times and places) as of the promiſes. Againe, the hypocrite applies the promiſes falſely, not according to the tenour of the Scripture,<note place="margin">The hypocrite applies the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes falſely to himſelfe, not regarding to ſeeke for in himſelfe the conditions by which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> but according to his owne fancie; not duly deducting his particular perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, out of the generall directions of the Word: but ſophiſtically concluding in his owne behalfe, according as beſt liketh him. The Lord hath made many gratious promiſes in his Word; by name, that principall promiſe of ſaluation. And it hath pleaſed God to limit theſe promiſes to thoſe that doe ſuch and ſuch things, requiring (as you would ſay) certaine conditions to be performed on his part, that muſt enioy theſe promiſes. Now the hypocrite, hee neuer looketh to his part, nor mindeth what care he hath of ſtanding to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but gapeth after the good thing promiſed,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20394:28"/>without any more adoe, and thinkes himſelfe ſure of that vpon ſome ſleithy reaſon, and there an end. Therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt warned them, that they ſhould not begin to ſay, wee haue <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, but ſhould bring forth fruites worthie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life. Heere hee ſhewes the fore (as it were) of their preſuming and falſe faith, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of the remedy. An hypocrite, hee loues to be ſhort in applying the promiſes, and doth it by enthymems; Chriſt dyed to ſaue ſinners, and therefore I ſhall be ſaued; forgetting to tell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe what things are required of ſuch ſinners as Chriſt muſt ſaue, and to conſider afore hee draw that concluſion, whether himſelfe haue the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch a ſinner, yea or no. Or thus, I ſhall be ſaued, becauſe I come to Church, receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, do many good things, or the like; not remembring that more is required than all this, of him that would be ſaued. But now the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,<note place="margin">The true-hearted applies truly, ſtill vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe to performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> he is more wary, and better aduiſed in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his concluſion, he will be ſure to finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thoſe graces, which are required in him whom the promiſes doe concerne, afore hee conclude to himſelfe, that hee ſhall receiue the promiſes. Hee will not content himſelfe to ſay, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord;</hi> I come to Church, &amp;c. nor to ſay, I haue <hi>Abraham</hi> for my Father: but he muſt finde in himſelfe fruits worthy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, or elſe he will neuer giue credit to his owne thoughts, that it ſhall be well with him: So the one doth build his ſpeciall concluſion vpon falſe grounds, and falſely deducteth his particular
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20394:29"/>aſſurance out of the generall promiſe, the other truely gathereth his comfortable aſſurance to him ſelfe, and will not hold faſt his concluſions, vnleſſe hee can by the Word of God aſſuredly iuſtifie his premiſes. The one reaſons falſely out of GODS Word, becauſe he neglects to proue both propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from thence: the other is neuer well, till hee can make good, by euidence of Scripture, both parts of his reaſon, and ſo his concluſion muſt needs hold good and ſure: for the holy Ghoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wrought thoſe graces in him, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes doe ſpecifie; cauſeth, that by comparing himſelfe with the promiſes, he can ſoundly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his owne heart: but the hypocrite not hauing theſe graces in him, and yet deſirous to enioy the benefits offered, will rather beleeue vpon ſleight proofes, than that hee will ſeeme to himſelfe to want a part in ſo pretious and excellent benefits. Thus the difference of the faith of the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the hypocrite hath beene laid open. The next thing wherein wee muſt make a compariſon betwixt them, is in the point of repentance.</p>

                     <p>REpentance (which is a turning from ſinne vnto God) hath two parts: the one humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in regard of the faults that haue

An hypocrite may goe a great way, both in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and in reformation, and yet hee will neuer goe farre enough. Let vs conſider what he can doe, and wherein hee giues himſelfe leaue to faile. An hypocrite then may come to be very ſory for ſome ſinne or ſinnes that he hath committed,<note place="margin">An hypocrite may confeſſe ſome ſinnes to God with great ſorrow.</note> and that ſo, as to weepe for it with ſome plentie of bitter teares, and alſo he may come to confeſſe his ſinne or ſinnes, not alone to men in ſome caſes, but in ſome caſes alſo to God in ſecret.<note place="margin">Exod: 9.17. &amp; 10.16.</note> And thus <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> once or twice acknowledged to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he had ſinned: no doubt with great ſorrow for the preſent time, that he had ſo long continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. So did <hi>Saul</hi> with teares confeſſe to <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.17. &amp; 26.21.</note> 
                        <hi>O my ſonne Dauid, I haue ſinned, and thou art more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous than I.</hi> So <hi>Iudas</hi> came with extremity of griefe in his heart (and no doubt alſo in his face) mainely crying out of himſelfe, and ſaying,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.4.</note> 
                        <hi>I haue ſinned in betraying innocent bloud.</hi> Yea, you know that <hi>Ahab</hi> did put on ſack-cloth, and went ſoftly, and faſted for his ſinne, and that ſo as God did note it in him, and forbeare him for it ſomwhat; which hee would not haue done, if hee had not ſeene him inwardly ſorrowfull for it, and if hee had not euen ſecretly confeſſed it vnto him.<note place="margin">1. Kings 21.27.</note> So farre may a diſſembler goe (for the beſt of theſe was but a diſſembler) in being humbled. But yet he doth much differ from the humiliation of the true godly man in theſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20394:30"/>things.<note place="margin">The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſorrow, reacheth alone to ſome groſſer ſinnes, not to the leſſer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, as that of the true hearted doth. Pſal. 51.5. Pſal. 19.12: Rom. 7.13.14.</note> Firſt, the hypocrite is ſorry for ſome one or two groſſe externall faults, that are more than ordinarily notorious and foule, as is to be ſeene in <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Saul;</hi> murder, ſhedding innocent blood, and ſeeking to ſlay the innocent. Theſe crimes (you ſee) touched theſe diſſemblers: but you neuer heard an hypocrite crying out as <hi>Dauid; In ſinne was I conceiued;</hi> and againe, <hi>Lord, who can know his errours? purge me from ſecret faults:</hi> nor with the Apoſtle, vexed with the law of his members, drawing him captiue to ſinne, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the law of the ſpirit within him. The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, the ſecret and vnknowne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed little diſorders of heart and life, eſpecially (the fountaine of all miſchiefes) the filthy ſtinking guzzle of Originall ſinne, the hypocrite laments not, bewaileth not, confeſſeth not with ſorrow and anguiſh of heart to God or man; but alone if hee fall into ſome groſſe notable crime, hee is much troubled and grieued for it, and ſometimes very ſorrowfull in confeſſing it. But the Chriſtian man can find out more hidden corruptions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and bewaile them, and feele the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of leſſe grieuous crimes, yea of things by the moſt, eſteemed no ſinnes; and for them can ſhame and blame, and condemne himſelfe before God. So the one waſheth his heart (as I ſaid before), the other his hands only,<note place="margin">The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſorrow and confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes but by fits, the true Chriſtians is ordinary and vſuall.</note> at the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the confeſſion of the hypocrite and his ſorrow comes but by fits and ſtarts, ſometimes, now and then, once or twice, and vſe it not. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome haue you <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaying, We haue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20394:30"/>ſinned, they are not often in this tune. It is a rare and vnuſuall thing, to ſee <hi>Ahab</hi> going ſoftly, to heare him ſighing for his ſinne. For indeed it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not from any ſuch ground in them, as may make it laſting or perpetuall; namely, a true ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſinne, or loue of God: but alone from a fearefull expectation of puniſhment, or a wearines of croſſes and afflictions. But now the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is very conſtant in his confeſſing, and (at leaſt) ſtriuing to lament ſinne. It is his vſuall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe, to blame himſelfe before God for his daily and particular tranſgreſſions: and hee is not well almoſt any day, vnleſſe he doe take ſome time, to accuſe and iudge himſelfe before his Maker. For indeede he walketh with God, and ſeeketh to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his heart vnto him, and therefore cannot but be frequent in laying open his heart vnto him, and powring out his ſoule before him. His heart will often ſo ſmite him, as to driue him into Gods preſence, and make him ſay, O Lord, I haue ſinned greatly, and done exceeding fooliſhly: but Lord doe away the ſinnes of thy ſeruant. Yea, he neuer almoſt committeth any ſinne, which he knowes to be a ſinne, but hee will confeſſe it, taking daily no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his daily ſlips, that he may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them. So the ſorrow and confeſſion of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites is in a quaume, when the good moode comes vpon them; as a drie hole that is full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon a great ſhower: but the confeſſing and mourning of the true Chriſtian is daily conſtant, perpetuall, in a ſettled and vſuall courſe; as the running of water in a fluent ſtreame, that hath iſſue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20394:31"/>from ſome liuing Fountaine, or Well-head.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">The hypocrits confeſſion and griefe is by force put vpon them, the true Chriſtians by themſelues willingly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for.</note> the ſorrow and confeſſion of hypocrites is likely put vpon them by a kind of violence, they be euen forced to it by ſome accident, ſo preſſing them for the time, that they can neither will nor chuſe, as the common ſaying hath. This is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the fore-named examples. What made <hi>Ahab</hi> walke in ſack-cloth with a ſoft pace? but becauſe he was threatned, the ruine of all his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and the vtter ſubuerſion of all his poſteritie: a tidings that could ſcarce chuſe, but make the heart of any Grand-father to ake and melt within him. When did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſay, <hi>The Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I and my people are ſinners?</hi> but when the plague lay ſo heauie vpon him, and ſtucke ſo cloſe vnto him, that he knew not which way in the world to turne himſelfe. And what made <hi>Saul</hi> breake forth with teares, and ſay, <hi>I haue ſinned?</hi> but that <hi>Dauid</hi> had then euen gone beyond all his expectations quite and cleane, and had vtterly ouercome him with kindneſſe, by requiting his euill with good. So <hi>Iudas</hi> confeſſed not his treaſon, till the very ſparkes of hell fier were all on a light flame within his ſoule; I meane, till the hideouſneſſe of a bitter and exaſperated conſcience did euen furiouſly purſue him, and driue him to this too-late and booteleſſe remedy. So the confeſſion of hypocrites is wreſted and extorted from them, euen as that of a traytor by the torture of the racke; and his griefe for his finne is a compelled griefe, as that of a ſlaue vnder the whip: but the true godly man, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant of Chriſt, doth voluntarily, and of his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20394:31"/>owne accord bring himſelfe before the Lord in humble and ſorrowfull confeſſions (though no ſuch violence be offered vnto him), euen out of a kindly worke of grace, mouing and inclining him ſtill to deſire to bee at one with God. The child of God doth euen long to be ſorrowfull for his ſinnes; and when no croſſe, affliction, or tentation lies vpon him, nor no other meanes of working him to griefe is vſed; then hee takes paines to rend his owne heart, and out of a good will to God, and in a kind of comfortable and ſweete ſence of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him, doth acknowledge his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. In very truth Gods child ſometimes (hauing almoſt kild himſelfe with a preſumptuous ſinne) is put to roaring and crying, through the weight of Gods hand, lying heauy vpon him day and night (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith of himſelfe),<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.3.</note> afore he can come to confeſſe his ſinne againſt himſelfe. But this is a rare caſe with a Chriſtian hart, that it ſhould need compulſion, to bring it downe in confeſſion before God:<note place="margin">1. Chron. 21.8</note> vſually he doth (as <hi>Dàuid</hi> after the numbring of the people) through the ſmiting of his owne heart, betake himſelfe vnto the Lord, &amp; ſay, <hi>O Lord, I haue done exce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eding fooliſhly:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 26.75.</note> and as <hi>Peter</hi> after his deniall of his Maſter, before any croſſe, before any force offered, out of his owne tenderneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, goe forth by and by, and weepe bitterly. Neither yet is Gods child ſo vnſenſible of a croſſe, but that his afflictions doe make him looke vnto his ſinnes, and beſtow thoſe teares in lamenting them, which the power of nature hath ſtirred vp. And it is an happy effect of his chaſtiſements, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20394:32"/>they increaſe his godly ſorrow, and ſo help to take away his ſinnes; but yet he doth not only mourne then: he doth labour, euen in proſperity to mourne for ſinne, and to make vſe of Gods kindneſſe in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing benefits, to become a meanes of humbling him, and making him grieue; and in a word, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow is a content vnto him, and nothing doth him more good, than that hee can kindly bewaile his ſinnes, and mourne ouer Ieſus Chriſt. A ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging croſſe, a bitter tentation, an earneſt exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the power of a good Sermon, may draw an hypocrite to teares: but a godly man without any of theſe things, will ſet himſelfe to mourne, and lament, and moſt willingly (out of the loue hee beares to God, whom his ſinnes haue offended) wil euen turne his ioy into ſorrow, and his laughter into teares. Thus you ſee the difference of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall humiliation from that, that is vpright.</p>
                     <p>Reformation is another part of repentance, and here we will ſhew, how much the hypocrite may reach vnto,<note place="margin">An hypocrite may amend his life very much by the meanes of the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and wherein he is defectiue. An hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may reforme diuers things that are amiſſe in him, and that at the preaching of the Word, and by meanes of the exhortations which hee heareth in a Sermon: but herein he faileth, that in ſome one or other thing, he muſt be held excuſed. Hee brooks not the generalitie of that little large word <hi>(all),</hi> you kill him when you preſſe vpon him that vniuerſall exhortation,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions.</hi> O no! this he cannot doe: ſome one or two faults are (as it were) darlings vnto him; his ſoule is in loue with them, and he muſt be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20394:32"/>with, he cannot leaue them. In any thing elſe hee will bee ruled by God: but in ſuch a thing hee muſt needs craue pardon, though it be a ſinne; hee hopes it is not ſo great, but that hee may bee borne withall therein: for alacke hee cannot liue vnleſſe he doe it, or ſo forth. The hypocrite hath euermore ſome hand or foote that he will not cut off; ſome eye that he will not pull out, and fling from him; ſome dearely beloued ſinne, ſome moſt pretious euill, ſome moſt ſweete or gainefull offence, that he cannot tell which way in the world to forgoe; and therefore loues not to heare of amending it, would not be reprooued for it, would not be called vpon to forſake it, would not think of it, but would turne away his thoughts from it, and would faine haue his conſcience alſo forbeare to vrge him in that matter.<note place="margin">The hypocrite ſtill liketh ſome one ſin, ſo that hee would not heare of it; the true Chriſtian would mend all, and deſires to heare moſt of thoſe hee can leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Pſal. 119.6.</note> He keepes ſome one or other wickedneſſe vnder his tongue, as a moſt daintie morſell, which he cannot find in his heart to ſpit out. But now the true godly man deſireth, and purpoſeth in all things to pleaſe God; hee hath reſpect (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh) to all Gods commandements, without picking or chuſing: he takes the whole Law as it lieth before him, and frameth his will to bow and bend which way ſoeuer God will haue it: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thing he knowes to bee a dutie, that hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to doe, without any further excepting or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling; and whatſoeuer he knoweth to be a ſinne, that he determineth to caſt from him, what euer it be, &amp; what euer may follow thereupon. He knowes that God is a Soueraigne commander, and that his will muſt be followed in one thing, as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Iames 2.10.</note>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:20394:33"/>and that hee which keepeth the whole Law beſides, failing (yet wittingly) in one point, is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all. Wherefore hee doth not dare to giue himſelfe a licence, of departing from the knowne way of Gods Law in any thing. Indeed a good man findeth ſome ſinnes harder to him to leaue than others, and ſome duties harder than others to performe: but yet his purpoſe, determination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, is to be found obedient to God in thoſe things alſo; and hee doth moſt earneſtly ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne corruptions there, where hee finds them moſt apt, to be oppoſite to Gods Word; and takes moſt paines to make himſelfe ſtraight, there where hee finds himſelfe moſt crooked: whereas the hypocrite tolerates ſome euill in himſelfe, and takes libertie ſo to tranſgreſſe, making ſome ſhift or other to daube vp his conſcience, and to ſecure himſelf from the checks thereof. Thus <hi>Iudas</hi> would neuer leaue purloyning and licking his fingers (as the prouer be hath it) after once the bag was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his cuſtodie. The true heart allowes no one knowne ſinne whatſoeuer; the hypocrite euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more allowes (at leaſt) ſome one ſinne, that hee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowes, or ſuſpects to be ſinne. Satan hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome peculiar, or exempt place in his heart and life, where hee may reigne without controle, and whether the iuriſdiction of Gods Word may not be ſuffered to extend.</p>
                     <p>And yet ſometimes alſo the hypocrite will ſeeme to make a proffer of pulling his necke out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans yoke,<note place="margin">The hypocrite for a little will make an offer to amend his beſt beloued ſinne.</note> by promiſing to leaue, and beginning (for a ſpirt) to make as if he would leaue his moſt

But this mood holdeth not long, he quickly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his old wallow, and laps vp (like an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane curre) his filthy vomit, which hee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſgorged. I do not meane, that he is ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only to do the ſame fault againe, once or twice, or oftner (for that may befall the true Chriſtian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo), but he proceedes to allow himſelfe in doing of it, to goe on in it, and follow it with greedineſſe; excuſing it, or hardning himſelfe in it, at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this paſſe, that hee cannot leaue it, that it is not poſſible; and therefore it is in vaine for him to ſtriue about an impoſſible matter, and ſo hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to make a trade of his ſin, for all his good promiſes and offers of reformation; as wee ſee in <hi>Simon,</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in <hi>Saul,</hi> and in others. But the true hearted hauing once ſet in, to caſt off his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſinne, doth neuer againe returne to allow it, and to wallow in it. He may fall againe, perhaps more then once or twice (and theſe relapſes are very dangerous, and very troubleſome): but he wil neuer ſtep backe to a reſolution of continuing ſo to ſinne, and of thinking that he cannot chuſe, and there is no remedie; but ſtill hee ariſeth out of the mire, reneweth his confeſſion, reneweth his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment, ſets in afreſh to bewaile his faults, and brings himſelfe againe to a firme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſinning no more, and in that purpoſe holds
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20394:34"/>himſelfe ſo long, till at length (it may be after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foiles) he attaineth ſtrength to offend no more groſſely in that matter, whatſoeuer it may be. Thus his faith becomes his victorie, and ſo he preuaileth againſt ſinne, and keepeth himſelfe, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one doth not touch him, and that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none iniquitie. And ſo much of this third point, concerning the agreement of the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the hypocrite and the true hearted, as alſo their differences. It remaineth to ſpeake in the like manner of their likeneſſe and vnlikeneſſe, in the matter of good life. I know that the leading of a good life, might well be referred to a branch of the ſecond part of repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> reformation: but I deſire to make it a diſtinct head of duties, for the more full and diſtinct handling of it in this reſpect, for which I haue now vndertaken to ſpeake of it.</p>

The hypocrite in both theſe may haue attained a large commendation before men: it may fall out; that he ſhall liue all his whole life long, without the committing of any ſuch ſinne,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20394:34"/>as ſhould cauſe him to inherite reproch in the world: what actions are groſſely wicked, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably ſhamefull before men, of thoſe the falſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may perhaps bee much more free than the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian. So the Phariſie (which yet was not iuſtified before God, and therfore was void of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes), could make his boaſts before God, that he was neither whoremonger, nor extortioner, nor drunkard (&amp; doubtles he might haue ſaid), nor cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, nor ſwearer, nor murtherer. This brag may ſeeme to prefer him before <hi>Dauid;</hi> &amp; before <hi>Lot,</hi> and before <hi>Noah;</hi> for neuer an one of them at his laſt end, was able to affirme ſo much of himſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, when he was a Phariſie, &amp; a notable hypocrite yet (as concerning the Law) did liue without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, as himſelfe afterwards (when he had no luſt to tell vntruthes in his owne behalfe) affirmeth of himſelfe.<note place="margin">An hypocrite in his freedom from groſſe ſins, boaſteth himſelfe and diſdaineth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the true hearted hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelfe and pitties o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Luke 18.11.</note> But the difference betwixt the true and falſe in this point, ſtandeth in two things. Firſt, the hypocrite in this innocency of his, is proud of himſelf, exalting himſelf with cracks &amp; vants vpon euery little occaſion, and inſulting ouer others, that are not alike innocent, with a plaine contempt and diſdaine of them. Yea, when he compares the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſinners with himſelfe, he doth it not alone with ſcorne of them, but ſometimes alſo with a kinde of bitternes. Thus our Sauiour brings in the Phariſie, crowing ouer the poore Publican, becauſe himſelfe was not like him, and thanking God (that is put in for form ſake) that he was no ſuch maner of man, as this Publican. And you know, how bitter the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies were againſt the poore ſinners; euen, ſo that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20394:35"/>they would not endure to bee touched by them, or once to ſit at meate with them. All this ariſeth from the blindneſſe of the hypocrite, who (not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer been diſcouered vnto himſelfe, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſinfulneſſe and fouleneſſe of his owne nature) imagines, that no more euill abideth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than ſhewes it ſelfe without; and that his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of heart is no greater, than that which breaketh forth in act: ſo fooliſhly taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the praiſe of Gods reſtraint, as if a man ſhould commend the carcaſſe for not ſtinking, when it was imbalmed. Now the true Chriſtian in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie from ſuch like palpable euils (if it fall out that the Lord haue pleaſed ſo to reſtraine him, for often it is otherwiſe with him), yet knowing the loathſome fouleneſſe of his owne heart, and being well acquainted with the bottomleſſe quagmire of his owne originall corruption, is ſtill humble and baſe in his owne eyes: for though he haue not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo foule abominations; yet no thankes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, but to the goodneſſe of God in reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for he of himſelf is euen as bad by nature, and ſhould haue done as bad (he knowes), if the Lord had in like manner giuen him ouer to himſelfe. Hence it comes alſo, that hee doth find his heart affected, as with iuſt zeale againſt groſſe ſinners, ſo with a pitifull and remorſefull diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whom he perceiueth to be no whit more wicked than himſelfe ſhould be, if the Lord did not preſerue him. But if the true Chriſtian haue either before his calling, liued in, or after his calling, ſlipt into ſome groſſe wickedneſſe (as <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:20394:35"/>was a perſecuter before his conuerſion; <hi>Dauid</hi> committed murder after) than is he for his whole life time after, much abaſhed in the remembrance of it, and made exceeding vile in his owne eyes. Thus the Publican durſt ſcarce aduance his eyes to heauen, but with a countenace repleniſhed with tokens of griefe and ſhame, ſmote himſelfe on the breſt, and begged mercy. And ſo the Apoſtle is very much in vilifying himſelfe (notwithſtanding the aboundant labours of his Apoſtleſhip) for his former bloody (though ignorant) perſecution.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the hypocrite (though perhaps he be not defiled with the groſſeſt and fouleſt acts of euill, yet) makes no bones of euils of the ſame kind, in ſmaller degrees, but commits them freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out checke of conſcience, or any remorſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for them afterwards.<note place="margin">Some hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing religion ſome goe but the common pace.</note> This is manifeſt by the Phariſies miſinterpreting of the Law, to ſerue their turnes this way: they condemned murder, but allowed reuenge: they blamed forſwearing, or periurie, ſmaller oathes they take none heede vnto; they forbad adulterie, but tooke no care to cut off the hand, and pull out the eye (that is, to mortifie the wantonneſſe and impuritie of their ſences); as our Sauiour ſhewes in that place they ſhould haue done. Doubtleſſe the courſe of their liues was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their interpretation of the Law; and their liues were as crooked, as they would make the ruler to ſeeme. Contrarily, the true Chriſtian (though ſometimes he may be ouercome in tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit ſome groſſe ſinne, yet) is vſually carefull to reſiſt all the degrees of ſinne, euen the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20394:36"/>very beginnings; and the firſt riſings thereof in heart, as our Sauiours more narrow interpreting of the Law (declaring the ſcantling of a godly mans endeauours aboue the Phariſies) doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly conuince. Hee looketh to the motions and deſires of his heart, and ſuffers not the leſſer euils to goe vnobſerued, and vnlamented. So the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is manifeſt in the firſt part of a good life, freedome from ſinne.</p>
                     <p>Now in the ſecond-part, care of wel-doing, wee will tracke the diſſembler,<note place="margin">The hypocrite often excels in ciuill righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and bounty, &amp;c.</note> and take him halting. Firſt, he doth oftentimes excell in ciuill righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and abound in workes of bountie and mercy; Who more liberall in great doles than the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? yea, haue not many Heathen men (and an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may ſurely attaine as much good as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell) been famous for diuers morall vertues; and by name, moſt exact obſeruation of iuſtice in their dealings? yet here the defiance is not hard to find out, if a man could looke into the heart of him that is hollow at heart.<note place="margin">The hypocrite in his deeds of mercy, &amp;c. ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them at ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; the true Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth ſuch fancies.</note> Firſt, in regard of the end of doing good this way, the hypocrit doth ſerue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in vaineglory, ſeeking the credit and applauſe of men, and to be commended in the world; and therefore for the moſt part he is careleſſe of doing ſuch good deeds, if there bee no witneſſe preſent, nor no likelihood of their being knowne abroad.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.5.</note> This our Sauiour noteth and taxeth in the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, who did all things to be ſeene of men, and euen cheriſhed in themſelues thoſe fond and fooliſh conceites and deſires of being ſo commended, ſo reſpected, ſo well thought of, and ſo full of glory,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20394:36"/>for their good deeds: but the true Chriſtian is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to withdraw his heart from liſtning vnto the worlds plaudit, he laboureth to approue himſelfe vnto God; and for the thoughts of worldly eſteem, hee is ready to fall out with himſelfe, for making account of ſuch foame of mens mouthes. He can ſay of himſelfe in other things, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelfe in one thing, that hee ſeeketh not to bee commended, he doth not goe a wooing for credit. So they ſhoote both with one arrow, but aime at a farre different marke; and this difference is plaine enough to be diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">The hypocrite will deale well with a friend. and one that is not a foe; but the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian with his preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed foes.</note> the hypocrite will ſhew kindneſſe and mercy, and charitie to his friends; or ſuch as haue neuer done him any great matter of wrong; or if they haue made him amends, and repayred the breaches of amitie by ſome proportionable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or benefit. But for his enemy that hateth him, that perſiſteth to wrong him, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeeketh to doe him hurt, he cannot finde in his heart to do him good, and ſcarce to practiſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, not at all kindneſſe and mercy to ſuch an one: yea, with the Phariſie, ſuch is his modell and ſquare of liuing, that hee will loue his quiet neighbour, but hate his troubleſome enemy as Chriſt doth taxe them, for peruerting the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law. The true-hearted Chriſtian ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth farre otherwiſe affected; he remembreth,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.43.</note> that God did loue him when hee was an enemy; and therefore alſo for his ſake hee will neuer leaue preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe, till he haue brought his heart to loue his enemy, and to do good to them, that doe euill
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20394:37"/>to him; and not alone to deale ſquarely, but louingly, kindly, mercifully, and (if need be) boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with his bittereſt and moſt cauſeleſſe aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. If his enemy hunger, he feedeth his enemy; if his enemy thirſt, he giues drinke to his enemy; if his enemy be falne, he lifts him vp; if wronged, he defends him; and ſo doing good there, where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon is moſt auerſe from doing good; he ſhewes himſelfe perfect, as his heauenly Father is perfect, as our Sauiour Chriſt exhorteth. Thus the extent of a ſincere mans goodneſſe doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the hypocrites, and (in one word) in ſuch caſes, and to ſuch perſons as he doth not, nor cannot, expect reward from men; yet the true Chriſtian will execute mercy and iudgement. The hypocrite euer faileth, where humaue motiues faile. And ſo for workes of mercy and iuſtice, wee haue ſhewed what ods betwixt the ſincere and guilefull; there are alſo exerciſes of piety and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein the hypocrite is often very forward. Let it not ſeeme out of place that I here ſpeake, what I forgat before.<note place="margin">The hypocrite maketh no bones of the ſmaller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of euill; the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtriueth againſt the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Math. 5.</note> For of the cloſe and groſſe hypocrites, there are two kinds that muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed each from other, becauſe their differences are remarkable. There are cold hypocrites that are carried forward in the veſſell of the time, and loue not to ouerrunne the common pace, in matters of religion (as your ordinary ciuill man, who yet is a very hypocrite, euen in that which he doth attaine vnto) others be more forward and feruent, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie then ſelues with a ſhew of more life, in matters of religion: ſuch was <hi>Paul</hi> before his calling, ſuch
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20394:37"/>were the Phariſies in their times, ſuch were <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Now theſe latter ſort of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites doe not alone (as the former) abound in workes of mercy and iuſtice,<note place="margin">An hypocrite may be very forward in duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> but alſo in duties of religion and pietie; they loue preaching, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and take delight in the company of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for pietie; they haue a very greene blade of being forward in Gods ſeruice, to the keeping of prayer in their families, and accuſtoming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate Sermons, and other like commendable acts of deuotion. The thorny and ſtony ground you know, did yeeld ſome more than common ſhewes of goodneſſe. And the wicked <hi>Simon</hi> conuerſed with <hi>Philip:</hi> yea, the ſinfull Iewes were as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in ſacrifices and fat beaſts, as their godly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. <hi>Paul</hi> was zealous of the Law, and there were many very forward Preachers in <hi>Pauls</hi> time alſo, whom a man would haue thought feruent, for the ſpreading abroad of the Goſpell; yet they did it not ſincerely. And did not the Phariſie keepe his weekely faſts, and other like obſeruations? yea, and did not <hi>Iehu</hi> alſo profeſſe (ſpeaking as hee thought in his heart), that hee was zealous for the Lord? Mark therefore the difference, which ſtands in two things. Firſt, in the end,<note place="margin">The hypocrite in all duties of religion ſerues himſelfe either in vaineglory, or ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the true Chriſtian ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at God in his ſeruices. Galat. 4.17.</note> then in the matter of their workes of piety, they ſtand farre aſunder one from the other. For the hypocrite, he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſerue himſelfe either in vaineglory, or in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or in both. So the falſe teachers in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, were zealous ouer the Galathians; but it was with an euill zeale (as <hi>Paul</hi> taxeth them), ſeeking to ingroſſe the people to themſelues, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20394:38"/>to exclude <hi>Paul,</hi> that they might wholly be admired. And did not the flaunting fellowes at Corinth plainely preach themſelues, as being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous of applauſe, and followers? And ſo <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes</hi> loued to be had in principall account in the Church; he deſired to be reputed the onely man, (which is the louing of firſt-hood,<note place="margin">2. Iohn.</note> as the Apoſtle calles it). The hypocrite (if he be a Preacher) doth labour (as with childe of a longing deſire) to be counted the beſt, or one of the beſt Preachers in the country; if he be onely a priuate man, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be eſteemed one of the forwardeſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and pleaſeth himſelfe well in ſuch fancies; yea, he hath a ſenſible edge, and a kinde of kore againſt thoſe, that ſtand betwixt him and this reputation. Neyther can he well away with ſuch, as beare away the credit and applauſe from him: as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue plainely in <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and in the Phariſies; ſo his religiouſneſſe hath a tacke of the ſame fault, that his ciuill righteouſneſſe hath. But the true-hearted Chriſtian ſerueth God in humility of ſpirit, not heeding what men deeme of him, further than their want of reſpecting him, will bee an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his doing of good.<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 2.6.</note> He ſeekes not praiſe of men, neither of you nor others, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth to his Theſſalonians. Wherefore he doth not things of contention, whetting himſelfe on, and putting an edge vpon himſelfe, with a hope and deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better than ſuch an one, or putting downe ſuch an one; but purely (out of a longing deſire to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, ſets himſelfe to doe the beſt hee can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing with his whole heart, to ſee the wel-doing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20394:38"/>of others; yea, glad at the ſoule, to ſee them farre exceede himſelfe, and wiſhing (with <hi>Paul</hi>) that all men were like him, yea, beyond him in all graces, And if contentious, vain-glorious, emulatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits ariſe within him, hee knits his browes againſt them, with as true heate of anger againſt himſelfe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had once againſt <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> when hee chode him ſharply, ſaying; <hi>Doſt thou enuy for my ſake?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 11.29.</note> But happily it may fall out, that the hypocrite will be driuen from ſeruing himſelfe in this vaine-glorious faſhion; yet then hee looketh to himſelfe with a more ſiniſter eye, if more may be: for he becomes a ſeruant to his owne heart ſuperſtitiouſly, as thoſe great ſacrificers in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Micah 6, 6, 7.</note> that would faine come before God with thouſands of Rammes, and with Riuers of Oyle; yea, that would giue their children for their ſins, the fruit of their body for the faults of their ſoules, refuſing no coſt nor hardnes, to earne pardon, and deſerue remiſſion, or make ſatisfaction, or redeeme to themſelues an hope of libertie to ſinne in ſome other kinde. They would pay. GOD for their euill deeds, with ſuch good deeds; and (after the cuſtome of men) cut ſcores with him; and therefore they doe not likely (that are ſo diſpoſed) content themſelues with enioyned ſeruices, but ſeeke ſome deuice of their owne, or ſome other ſect maſter, whereby they haue great hope to winne God vnto them. Now the true Chriſtian, he is of a farre other minde, he cotuits all dung, and all droſſe; yea, he reputeth all loſſe, ſo that he may get Chriſt, vpon him he relyeth, to him hee cleaueth, and neuer dreames of other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20394:39"/>than thoſe that he findes in him (for hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth himſelfe) being the true circumciſion, that puts no confidence in the fleſh. And hence it is, that hee doth not dare to tolerate himſelfe the more in any ſinne, becauſe of his deuotion and zealouſneſſe in other points. So the ſcope of the ſound and hollow is oppoſite; the ones eye lookes heauen-ward, the others is bent ſtill to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The matter alſo wherein their deuotions ſhew themſelues, will manifeſt whence they come: from truth,<note place="margin">The hypocrite moſt forward in publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may know of; the Chriſtian in ſecret, that none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know of, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> or from guile. For the hypocrite, his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt deuotion (vnleſſe it be when ſuperſtition (like as a bree doth the poore beaſt) doth pricke him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) is in duties that may be, and are done with a witneſſe: as for thoſe that are priuate, or rather ſecret, he is key-cold in them, at leaſt vſually, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth, doth he trouble his Cloſet often with priuate meditations and prayers. Hence it is, that our Sauiour correcting the miſ-intended deuotion of the Phariſies, doth confine them to their Cloſet, where God alone beholdeth and heareth: intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they had little luſt to pray in ſecret, where God that ſaw in ſecret ſhould be their ſole rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So you may know if you diſſemble yea or no. The diſſembling man can preach well to others, hee cannot digeſt what himſelfe hath cooked, and preach it to himſelfe in his priuy meditations. He can pray when others ſtand by, but moſt times (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be whipped forward by a croſſe for a fit) he is tongue tied, and dumb-ſtricken in his chamber. So he loues to heare Sermons; and to repeate them in company; but he loueth not to get alone, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20394:39"/>concoct the Sermon in his owne meditation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and remembring what he hath heard, and how it concerneth himſelfe. But now, the true Chriſtian is rather more vehement in priuate than in publike prayers, and can much rather omit the calling vpon God with others, than thoſe ſecret and inward communications with God, wherein he may freely powre his whole ſoule forth vnto the Lord: and hee ſatisfieth not himſelfe, in hauing heard the Sermon, vnleſſe hee haue chewed the cud, and conſidered if thoſe things were ſo, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined himſelfe by that rule. He is conſtant alſo in priuate ſeruices, as well as publike, and the moſt ſecret, as well as thoſe that muſt haue companions.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, for the matter, or rather manner of their performing theſe duties of pietie.<note place="margin">The hypocrite reſts himſelfe ſatisfied in the act formally done, the true Chriſtian is not well, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he finde the inward po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it.</note> The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite doth reſt himſelfe ſatisfied in the formality of religion, in the externall act, in a good and formall faſhion diſcharged, not greatly heeding the power of religion in his ſoule, and the ſecret diſpoſition of his heart. If hee haue framed a good prayer, in fit words, and vttered it in conuenient geſtures, he is well apaide, and hopes the ſeruice ſhall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though hee had not any working of feruour in his heart, any life, any feeling, any true touch of the things which his tongue did vtter. If he haue ſayd good words with a good intent, all is well; though his affections had not the impreſſion of the matter of his words ſetled in them. So, if hee heare the Word with decent intention, and can carry away a good part of it, to ſpeake of afterwards, if occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerue, it is well, hee is herein ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20394:40"/>though his ſoule hath not beene ſtirred with the power of the Word. Euen as the falſe-hearted Iewes eſteemed themſelues to haue aboundantly ſatisfied the Law, if they did tie the ſacrifices with cords to the Altar, though their ſoules were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing affected with the ſpirituall things, that thoſe externall types did repreſent. But the vpright ſoule is much diſpleaſed with himſelfe and his ſeruices, vnleſſe hee feele the power of godlineſſe in them. Hence it is, that hee is very ſenſible of deadneſſe, and calles much (with <hi>Dauid</hi>) for quickening, and vnleſſe hee finde the efficacie and fruit of good exerciſes in his heart, hee is much diſquieted, and diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and cannot tell how to be ſatisfied with hauing ſo ſerued God: for hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to God that ſearcheth the heart, and therefore it cannot giue him content, if hee haue not found his worſhip hearty. And ſo doe the true and falſe Chriſtians deuotions differ for end, matter, and manner.</p>
                     <p>Now there is a third thing conſiderable in the point of good liuing,<note place="margin">An hypocrite is often preciſe in petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſo is alſo the true chriſtian ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aboue that he ſhould.</note> wherein they muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together. The hypocrite is often very ſtrict in matters of ceremony, and in ſuch ſmall points that concerne Gods worſhip; and in other pettie matters alſo: ſo a Phariſie would not goe into the Iudgement hall, to be defiled againſt the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for any thing. Hee would not neglect to pay tithe-mint for a world, you ſee him ſtraining at a Gnat. And diuers times it falles out alſo, that the true-hearted Chriſtian (out of ſcrupulous miſ-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and an ouer-tenderneſſe of conſcience, not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20394:40"/>ſufficiently tempered with exactneſſe of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or out of a long cuſtome of beeing of ſuch a iudgement, and much conuerſing with men of ſuch opinion, is euen more ſtrict than hee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and depriueth himſelfe of his lawfull liberty of doing or forbearing, what he might eyther doe or forbeare.<note place="margin">The hypocrite cenſorious in his ſtrictneſſe: the Chriſtian gentle to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from him.</note> But there are two manifeſt differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this matter: the hypocrite is as cenſorious as ſtrict, as large in condemning others, that jumpe not with him in iudgement and practiſe, as narrow in ſtraightning himſelfe about ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hee is bitter, ſharpe, tarte in his cenſures of them, that are differently minded, neither can hold peace with them, nor ſuffer himſelfe to maintaine any good conceit of them, but conceiueth that they make conſcience of nothing, becauſe their conſciences be not of his owne laſte. So the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies could not brooke Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for not waſhing: and the hypocriticall falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, euen made a very rend in the Church, about aboliſhed ceremonies of the Law. But the true Chriſtian in caſes of ſuch difference, holdes the bond of Peace in the vnitie of the Spirit, not iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor deſpiſing others, but charitably referring them to their owne maſter, to whom they ſtand or fall: he that eateth, not condemning him that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not; hee that eateth not, not cenſuring him that eateth; but both louingly bearing with each other, becauſe they both giue thankes, and ſeeke to bring glory to one maſter. The hypocrite will almoſt allow no man the name of a Chriſtian, at leaſt, the eſteeme and affection due to one, if hee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20394:41"/>concurre not with his iudgement: the true-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is euer charitable to the contrary ſide in ſuch diuerſities.</p>
                     <p>Againe,<note place="margin">The hypocrite is not ſutable and regular in his ſtrictneſſe, but the true Chriſtian is.</note> the hypocrite is not ſutable to himſelfe in his ſtrictneſſe; for hee is large conſcienced e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in other matters, and can ſwallow a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell with the ſame throat, which did euen keckle at a Gnat: if a greater and more apparant fault be more interlarded with profit, it goes downe glibly enough, although theſe little leane morſells doe ſticke in the paſſage. Such well oiled faults, though of a larger quantity, either he cares not to ſee, or amend, ſo that you would as much wonder at the greatneſſe of his ſwallow in ſome things (eſpecially where pleaſure and profit pleade the caſe), as ſeeme ſtrange at the too too much ſtreightneſſe of it, in other caſes; and maruaile either how hee ſhould be ſo Eagle-eyed, as to ſee ſo ſmall a matter in one kinde; or elſe ſo beetle-eyed, as not to ſee ſo plaine a thing in another. But the vpright heart is like himſelfe in his ſtrictneſſe, and equall and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in his making conſcience of things. Hee is more troubled in greater matters, than in leſſer; and his conſcience will checke him, and order him with more or leſſe vehemency, and earneſtneſſe in things; according as the things he doth, or doth not, are of more or leſſe weight and moment. And euen as ſtraight as he is in ſome things, ſo ſtraight will hee likewiſe ſhew himſelfe in other things of the like degree. And thus you haue (as neare as I was able to gather it out of Scripture) the true and manifeſt difference betwixt the ſincere and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20394:41"/>in theſe particular graces. Yet ſtill let mee bee bold to put you in remembrance, of what I ſpake at firſt, and that ſeaſonably in this concluſion of the whole diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that becauſe the moſt vprightly minded is not without ſome plaine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of guile: therefore many of the effects and ſignes of guile, wil begin to worke and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in him alſo; but ſo that he doth obſerue, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſiſt and oppoſe the ſame, and continue to controle his owne heart for them, till by degrees he haue gotten the better of them. And ſo hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called an hypocrite, though he haue much hypocriſie in him: contrarily, the hollow hearted (though he be cleane ouer-runne with theſe effects of falſe-hood, yet) neglecteth to obſerue them, or is not much troubled at them, when he finds them; and therefore he muſt take his name from the vice of hypocriſie, becauſe it beareth ſway, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth dominion ouer him. And thus now haue we explained the point in hand, and ſo made way for the vſes, which we are to gather from it.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20394:42"/>there are, and alwayes haue beene, and euer will be in the Churches, diſſemblere, as well as ſincere Chriſtians:<note place="margin">Euery man out of a godly iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ouer himſelfe, muſt examine what himſelfe is.</note> it behoueth therefore, that euery man, out of an holy iealouſie ouer himſelfe, and a godly fear of ulneſſe of himſelfe, doe often and ſeriouſly try and examine what he is, and not paſſe ſentence of himſelfe one way nor other, till by touch-ſtone of the Scripture, he hath made proofe of himſelfe. In other caſes wee would all eaſily condiſcend to ſuch an exhortation. Were it moſt certaine, that within this quarter of an houre, an hundred or two of this Congregation muſt leaue this preſent life, how would euery one feare, leſt the lot of death might fall vpon himſelfe? and how carefull would each one bee, if it were poſſible to come vnto the knowledge of the matter, whether himſelfe ſhould be amongſt the liuing or the dead. Brethren, it is certaine, that in the Church of God, there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hypocrites which muſt be damned: this our Sauiour teacheth here, and we haue deliuered you in his name. Can it therefore but be needefull for euery one amongſt you, to make a diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie into his owne eſtate? and that ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe this very willingneſſe to ſearch into ones ſelfe,<note place="margin">Willingnes to ſearch, a ſigne of truth; the the contrary, of falſehood,</note> is a good ſigne of truth, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of falſe-hood. The hypocrite of the cloſer ſort, is onely therefore an hypocrite, becauſe he will not endure the paines of diſcouering his owne hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. An hypocrite in the hearing of ſuch a point as this, can ſoone ſee cauſe enough in his conceit, to thinke hardly of another man. Sure, if this be ſo (ſaith he within himſelfe), ſuch a man muſt needes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20394:42"/>be in hard caſe, for he can be no better than an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: but for himſelfe, hee letteth paſſe all ſuch thoughts concerning himſelfe, and feedes himſelfe ſtill with his former ſtrong, and long continued conceit, of being a good Chriſtian, what euer men thinke of him. But the true Chriſtian, vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſuch things (becauſe hee hath had ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the guilefulneſſe of his owne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) is therefore apt to be timorous of himſelfe, and thinkes to this effect within himſelfe: Alas, what is mine eſtate, theſe things come hard vpon mee! I feare, I feare much, leſt all be not well within me! And ſo ſearching, he findeth hollowneſſe; finding, bewaileth it; bewailing, confeſſeth it; confeſſing, reformeth it; and reforming, is not ouercome by it. Wherefore againe and againe I beſeech you, let euery man and woman conſider diligently of himſelfe; let him trie and prooue his eſtate by the notes which I haue formerly ſet downe, in as much plaineneſſe and perſpicuitie as I could. Say thou that heareſt the Word of God this day, in which thou art taught, that the true Vine hath branches on it that be not true, as well as thoſe that be true; what doſt thou deeme of thy ſelfe? Art thou an vpright-hearted man, or a diſſembler? Againe, I demand of thee, what a kinde of Chriſtian thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſt thy ſelfe? In name and ſhew, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou art one of Chriſts members; but art thou ſo indeed and truth, or art thou not? Thine anſwer will like enough be this; That thou hopeſt thou art a true Chriſtian. I ſay vnto thee therfore, that it may fall out, thou couldſt not ſo much as ſay, thou didſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20394:43"/>hope ſo, if thou didſt not anſwere raſhly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all deliberation, becauſe thou art an errand groſſe hypocrite, that doſt know thy ſelfe (if thou wouldeſt confeſſe it), but meerely to counterfeit ſome outward ſhew of goodneſſe; whereas in thy ſecret conuerſation, and the vnobſerued parts of thy life, thou followeſt and likeſt wickedneſſe well euough. And if it be ſo, ſuffer not thine heart to beguile thee any longer, and lay no clayme to the name of a true Chriſtian, which thy ſelfe doſt well enough perceiue, to be altogether vnbecomming one of thy carriage. Come now, and grow to take notice of that monſtrous groſſe guile, which thou canſt not but feele within thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Some doe thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpright, yet at end proue falſe.</note> if thou wilt but lay thine hand vpon it. But if thou boaſt not ſo groſſely, and ſo palpably hypocriticall, but that it may bee poſſible for thee to ſay deliberately, that thou hopeſt thou art a true Chriſtian; yet I wiſh thee to take great heed, that thine hopes be not ill grounded: for many a man thinketh and hopeth, that he is vpright, which in the end proueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe otherwiſe, and looſeth all his faire hopes; and ſo is fulfilled vpon him that the Scripture affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: the expectation of the wicked ſhall periſh. But willt thou know indeed what to ſay of thy ſelfe? then lay the line to thine owne ſoule, and apply thy ſelfe to the rules formerly ſet downe. Say then; Where findeſt thou moſt faults? at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? in thine owne heart,<note place="margin">Where doſt thou find moſt faults?</note> or in the wayes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? And what faults doe moſt diſquiet and trouble thee, and make thee moſt inward worke and heauineſſe? thine owne, or thoſe of other men?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20394:43"/>If thine owne, in all likelihood all is well with thee: if other mens; loe here, the carping vaine of an hypocrite; lay thine hand vpon it, and feele it with ſhame and ſorrow, and ſay to thy ſelfe; O now! the pulſe of my ſoule beates hollow: and hereafter (till thou haue turned thine edge another way) take not thy ſelfe for other than thou art, an hypocrite. If thou feeleſt this buſie medling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and lamenteſt it, thou art not ouercome of hypocriſie: but if it carry thee away, and thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieſt thy ſelfe in it, and thinkeſt thou haſt cauſe ſo to doe, and reſiſteſt it not: I condemne thee for a ranke diſſembler. But tell me yet further;<note place="margin">Art thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidene or feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of thy ſelfe?</note> how ſtandeſt thou affected towards thy ſelfe? art thou bold, confident, aduentrous, dreaming that (thou troweſt) all the world ſhall not draw thee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch a ſinne, and bragging that thou art one of theſe diſſemblers? Or art thou fearefull of thy ſelfe, ſcarce daring to truſt thy ſelfe, and often almoſt ready to tremble for feare, leſt thou ſhouldeſt bee beguiled in thy ſelfe?

And tell mee yet againe: doe times, company, places, make ſuch a change in thee, that what euill thou wilt not doe in one place or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; that, thou wilt do in another? and what good
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20394:44"/>thou doſt in ſome places and times,<note place="margin">Doth compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, place, &amp;c. change thee, yea or no?</note> that thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not to performe in others?

But proceed wee in this examination. Is all or thy chiefe care of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and ſo that thou neyther doe nor ſpeake euill, it ſeemeth not much materiall to thee what thou thinkeſt; and if thou canſt refraine from beeing externally naught, thou little heedeſt or careſt for the naughtineſſe of thine hidden man?<note place="margin">Is thy care moſt of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or of the inward motions alſo?</note> I affirme againſt thee then, that thou art but a whited tomb.

But let vs goe a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to worke. Thou haſt good knowledge of the Word of God; and what of that? Therefore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20394:44"/>thou concludeſt, that thou art a good Chriſtian. I anſwer, thou collecteſt amiſſe, for this may befall a <hi>Iudas</hi> and a <hi>Balaam.</hi>

But let your naturall backwardneſſe to this in quiry, and Satans ſenſible oppoſing it, be ſufficient proofes vnto you, of its needfulneſſe and profit both. Were it not a great helpe to the ſubduing of the fleſh, the fleſh would not be repugnant vnto it: were it not a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20394:47"/>meanes of chaſing out Satan, Satan would neuer withdraw you from it. But be iealous ouer your ſelues, feare much, ſuſpect much, enquire much, and preuent the euill of ſecuritie, and the growth of hypocriſie.<note place="margin">We muſt not alwayes be in ſuſpence of our ſelues, but beware of too much haſte in determining.</note> I doe not wiſh you alwayes to ſtand in ſuſpence of your ſelues, and ſtill to bee doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whether you bee true Chriſtians or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers: it is no part of my meaning, to driue you vnto this vncomfortable vncertainty. But I wiſh you not to make too much haſte, to thinke your ſelues certaine, for feare your certainety ſhould proue but a certaine deluſion. When thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and againe, and againe tryed thy ſelfe by the things formerly deliuered (or any other that thy ſelfe canſt conceiue of, or others of better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in theſe matters can helpe thee vnto), then thou mayeſt boldly hold faſt (if thou findeſt cauſe to hold) this concluſion; I am ſure I am not a withering branch. But if thou be too willing to thinke well of thy ſelfe, and wilt ſpeedily reſolue (to ſaue the labour and trouble of inquiring and narrow trying), that thou knoweſt thou art vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; then aſſure thy ſelfe, that deſpaire at length will ſhake thee out of this deluded thought, if damnation doe not ouer-whelme thee in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of it.

                     <p>What the prouerbe preſcribeth to be done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, if thou wouldeſt not be couſoned of thy goods, that doe thou to thy ſelfe, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not beguile thy ſelfe of thy ſaluation; Trie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou truſteſt. The moſt of thoſe that liue in the boſome of the Church, are ignorant of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall guilefulneſſe of their owne hearts. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not how ſubiect they are to that notable trick of folly that wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of, ſaying; <hi>The fooliſh beleeueth euery thing:</hi> eſpecially euery good word that his owne ſelfe-flattering heart will buzze into his eares. But the wiſedome of the wiſe, is, to vnderſtand his way, hee will haue good footing and ground, for his good opinion of himſelfe, or elſe hee will not reſt vpon them. Wherefore take heede of being deceiued with that deceit, which <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth, the folly of fooles: euen to take paines to beguile your ſelues, in reſting vpon a lye, in a matter of this maine conſequence. We ſee and wonder, that many men will not be diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from accounting themſelues true Chriſtians, though euery man that hath an eye, may ſee, that nothing is Chriſtian in them but the out-ſide, and not all that neither. If they make the leaſt ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of pietic; if they be not as bad as the worſt of all the limmes of Satan; if they can find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the leaſt ſhaddow of any thing, that may be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20394:48"/>called vertuous; they lay faſt hold vpon their owne fancies, and will not conſider, that it is the folly of fooles to deceiue themſelues. O that wee could driue you out of this folly! O that we could bring you to ſee (that that all confeſſe, but in their owne caſes, few or none ſeeme to conſider) that in the Church, I ſay in the Church, I ſay againe in the trueſt and pureſt Church vpon the earth, there be not alone ſome, but many hypocrites; that you might not ſatisfie your ſelues with ſuch ſimple al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations; for the proofe of your being good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as the moſt are wont to doe: but that by looking narrowly, and digging deepely, and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diuing into the bottome of your ſoules, you may at laſt know your ſelues with an infallible and ſure vnderſtanding, not to be hypocrites, but true hearted. And this is one vſe for all men, that all ſhould trie themſelues what they be.</p>

Wherefore Lord I confeſſe vnto thee, I euen free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe vnto thee, that hitherto I haue beene no better than a painted Sepulcher, full of rottenneſſe. I haue beene more troubled at other mens faults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, than mine againſt thee: and I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my ſelfe in this prepoſterous earneſtnes, and thought I had cauſe to be ſo. I haue bin ventrous, confident, and apt to preſume of my ſelfe, and yet haue neuer lamented this carnall confidence. I haue giuen my ſelfe leaue to doe the euill in ſecret, which I would not for a world haue done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and yet haue taken no care to lament it, becauſe I thought, Piſh, it is no matter, no man ſhall euer know it. I haue giuen free ſcope to the foule motions of mine heart, and taken no care to controle and oppoſe the looſeneſſe and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wicked imaginations. My knowledge hath made me proud, and in ſome things I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to know, and yet I neyther bewayled my pride, nor my witting blindneſſe. I haue taken no care to ponder on thy word, and ſettle it deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my ſoule: and yet haue not ſeene mine owne folly, in being careleſſe to couer this ſeede with earth. I haue miſ-applied thy gratious promiſes in Chriſt, rather imboldening my ſelfe in euill by them, then vſing them to the purging of mine heart and life: and yet I haue not lamented before thee this my preſumptuouſneſſe. I haue confeſſed my faults, but alacke ſeldome, and when a croſſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20394:50"/>hath compelled me, not elſe. I haue amended ſome things: but alas ſome thing alone, this or this (name thou the particular to God), I could neuer bring my ſelfe to be willing to amend: or if I haue been willing for a paſſion, that willingneſſe hath held but a little time, and yet I haue flattered my ſelfe with vaine ſhifts, and haue not abhorred this my guile. I haue indeede forborne reproachfull ſinnes; but euills of leſſe groſſeneſſe I haue boldly committed, and neuer been troubled with them. Vaine-glory hath ſtained my deedes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I haue not ſeene and bewailed it. I could not bring mine heart to doe good againſt euill, nor ſeriouſly blame my ſelfe for this reuengefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but been ready to thinke, it was more than any man aliue could be able to doe. I haue ſought the praiſe of men, in acts of thy ſeruice, and it hath not been bitter to my ſoule to haue thus miſ-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thine ordinances. I haue beene vtterly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of ſecret ſeruices, when I haue ſeemed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in publike, and yet been well enough conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that careleſneſſe. I haue been well enough pleaſed with the bare out-ſide of religious duties, and taken no paines to finde the life of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me. I haue contented my ſelfe with lippe-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eare-hearing, and not beene abaſed in my ſelfe for want of feruent praying, and powerfull hearing. I haue beene cenſorious againſt thoſe that haue not beene as ſtrict as my ſelfe, in matters of ceremony; and could ſcarce abide them, that could abide thoſe petty things, which I haue diſliked; and yet I neuer lamented, but rather applauded
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20394:50"/>my ſelfe in this bitterneſſe: and I my ſelfe haue beene very careleſſe of greater things, when profit pleaded for them, that haue ſeemed ſo very ſtrict in formes and ſhaddowes, and externall rites: and yet I pleaſed my ſelfe well enough in this largeneſſe of conſcience. O Lord, thy Word hath found me out, thy Word hath diſcouered vnto mee the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of mine heart: it hath iudged me, it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned me, I deſire to giue glory to thee, and no longer to hide my ſinnes, this ſinne, this vpholder of all ſinnes, this damnable hypocriſie. I ſee it hath ruled in me, and I (for want of care) haue neuer yet perceiued it: but now I perceiue it, and now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, O Lord, to thee that knoweſt it already, to thee from whom it cannot be hidden. I humbly acknowledge, I haue all this while beene but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, will yee thus pleade guilty,<note place="margin">A man ſhall be loath thus to confeſſe his hypocriſie.</note> if you bee guilty before the Lord? I know it is maruellous hard, to bring the guilty ſoule to plaine confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſelfe-loue raigneth in our hearts naturally, and that can hardly endure to ſpeake any euill againſt it ſelfe, though vpon neuer ſo iuſt cauſe. Hee that hath long fed himſelfe, and made himſelfe (if not peaceable, yet) ſecure, with telling himſelfe he was a good Chriſtian; will be very loath now (perhaps after many yeares abiding in this falſe opinion) to acknowledge himſelfe to haue been deceiued. We ſee it is very hard to draw men out of thoſe errours, wherin they haue been long trained vp. Euery man hath been euen trained vp in a conceit, that he was a good Chriſtian. It is conceit hath long poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20394:51"/>him, and this errour hath become a very preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice within him, he hath euer taken it for granted, and beene angry that it ſhould be once called into queſtion. It is therefore no wonder, if men finde themſelues loath to recant their owne good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of themſelues, and to goe from all that they haue formerly eſteemed vndenyable. But for all this,<note place="margin">But he muſt for all that, confeſſe.</note> I pray you be perſwaded, to ſee your ſelues to haue been diſſemblers, if you haue been ſuch, for all your vnnaturall vnwillingneſſe. The theefe indeed hath cauſe (as he thinketh) to be impudent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying himſelfe to haue committed felony (though he know full well, that he hath committed it), be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe confeſſion is required of him, as an helpe to his conuiction, and ſo to his condemning. But the Lord of heauen doth not deſire thee to confeſſe thy ſelfe to haue been but an hypocrite, becauſe he wanteth other meanes to conuict thee, or becauſe hee may the more eaſily proceede to condemne thee:<note place="margin">For that is the onely way to get it pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> nay, therefore onely he would haue thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that thou mayeſt be capable of pardon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an ouer-ruled caſe in heauen, and a thing peremptorily concluded of by the Diuine iuſtice, that no ſinner ſhall euer be pardoned, till he deale plainely, and freely confeſſe, that he is ſuch a ſinner as he is. Thy confeſſion is called for, onely to ſit thee for pardon, not to vrge againſt thee to any worſe purpoſe. Wherefore forbeare no longer, winke no longer, be ignorant of thy ſelfe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hide thy guile no longer, but in thy very ſoule now, in the thoughts of it, and heereafter in more words, twixt God and thy ſelfe in ſecret, ſay vnto
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20394:51"/>the Lord, and deny not, but acknowledge: O Lord, I ſee plainely, that yet I haue been but an by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
                     <p>Brethren,<note place="margin">And if he doe it not, he is no whit ſafer.</note> ignorance of ones ill eſtate cannot helpe it. Is a man one iot the better, if he be an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, becauſe hee refuſeth to acknowledge it? Shall he ſcape better, becauſe he can make himſelfe blinde, and not ſee it? Doubtleſſe the Lord will diſcouer the ſecrets of euery ſoule at the laſt day, and at the day of death; to euery mans ſoule firſt, and after to all the world: and then a man ſhall be diſcouered to himſelfe fearefully and horribly, without all hope, without all poſſibilitie of being pardoned. Suffer the Word of God (wherein hee comes to exerciſe iudgement in a mercifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) to draw you to a plaine and ſauing acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that you may not be forced by the laſt ſentence, to ſee and feele your hypocriſie, when there will be neither leaſure nor meanes to redreſſe it. Now thou mayeſt be helped, now thou mayeſt be changed, from an hypocrite to a true Chriſtian, from a diſſembler to ſoundneſſe of ſpirit. Now therefore, whileſt vpon confeſſion, mercy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may be procured, bring thy ſoule to it, and ſuffer the Word of God to ouer-rule all thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe, and fall to a free confeſſion, and (as I haue often ſaid) tell the God of heauen: O Lord, It is true, too true, too plaine, I cannot deny it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I will deny it wilfully, and againſt my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I am but an hypocrite as yet. Brethren, wee therefore labour about this point ſo much, becauſe we doe well know the neceſſitie of it. If we cannot
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20394:52"/>attaine thus much from you,<note place="margin">But ſhall for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remain ſo.</note> you will alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine hypocrites, and the Word of God (through your oppoſing it) will prooue but a meanes of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening you in your hypocriſie: but if we draw you to acknowledgement, it will not be impoſſible to direct you to amendment. I know that your hearts may poſſibly hold off from confeſſion, by thinking to this effect; That if you haue beene but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites all this while, it will neuer bee better with you, and you ſhall neuer attaine to be vpright. But this is a falſe ſuggeſtion of Satan. If you will not ſee your ſelues to haue but diſſembled, you ſhall in very deede neuer be better, but rather worſe and worſe, and more and more ſold vnder the power of hypocriſie:<note place="margin">Only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting hee may be made true.</note> but if you will ſee it, and lament it before God, and oppoſe it, by ſtriuing to caſt out the beloued ſinne, and to ſtep that one ſtep, which hitherto you haue not ſtepped, of falling out with that one ſinne whatſoeuer, which hitherto you haue harboured, and conſtant praying againſt that one fault, which hitherto you haue been content to winke at, and let paſſe with a priuiledge of, Seene and allowed; you ſhall bee true, you ſhall bee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, you ſhalbe ſincere, and of fruitleſſe &amp; barren, become fruitfull and profitable branches. A man may weep out hypocriſie, aſwel as other vices; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and lamenting guile, will ſurely free a man from the power of guile, and hee ſhall ceaſe to be an hypocrite, that will now begin, &amp; hereafter dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue, to ſee, acknowledge, and bewayle his hypocriſie before the Lord, who ſees and hates it, where it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed: ſees &amp; pities it, where it is.</p>

There be in the Churches true-hearted Chriſtians, good ground, ſheep, and good corne: and thoſe amongſt you, that in trying doe finde your ſelues ſuch; and by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofe, can cleare it to your ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you haue often heeretofore found out, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and bewayled thoſe effects of hypocriſie, which haue beene deliuered; doe you (I pray you) enioy the comfort of your vprightneſſe, and let God that wrought it, haue the glory.<note place="margin">Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note> The good Chriſtian is almoſt as fearefull to ſettle himſelfe in a good opinion of himſelfe, as the falſe vnwilling to be driuen from it. But there is no reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the innocent ſhould be condemned. A man may bee wrongfull and iniurious to God and to himſelfe, in being ouer fearefull to confeſſe the good worke of God in himſelfe. Chriſt hath liuing members in his body: if thou beeſt one of them, acknowledge it, and be glad of it, that thou mayeſt with all due care proceede in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, now that thou knoweſt, thou haſt ſet in, to ſome purpoſe. If Satan cannot keepe a man from truth, yet hee will endeauour to hinder him, from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20394:53"/>taking the comfort of it:<note place="margin">And Satans tentations.</note> but let not his lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile thee any longer. Say vnto him; I find mine owne faults more burdenſome to me than others; I find my ſelfe carefull of mine inward man, as well as of mine outward; I find my ſelfe humbled, euen by my freedome from groſſe ſinnes: and if at any time any fruit of hypocriſie doe ſhew it ſelfe (as alacke too too often it doth), I make haſte to bring it before God, and there I condemne it, there I humble my ſelfe for it: wherefore I am ſure I am true-hearted; O Lord, I bleſſe thy name that haſt made me true, and I pray thee make mee more and more true. Surely beloued, it will be a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to your thankefulneſſe, if you doe not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour againſt thoſe cauils, by which Satan would faine couer your comforts from your eies. He will tell thee of thy cenſoriouſneſſe; of thy falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and againe, and againe, into ſuch a fault, perhaps groſſe; of thy deadneſſe in priuate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion; and of thy many vaine-glorious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of thy much ſelfe-conceitedneſſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things; and he will labour to make thee thinke, that it is not poſſible that heart ſhould haue any truth, in which ſo many fruits of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie may be found. Thou muſt anſwer him, that thou confeſſeſt thy ſelfe, to be very full of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of diſſimulation; and that therefore alſo thou acknowledgeſt the roote from which they grow, to be too too ſtrong and bigge within thee. But thou mayeſt ſay withall; I haue been taught, and I know it is true, that not the man in whom hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is, but he in whom it ruleth, muſt be called an
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20394:53"/>hypocrite: and for thy ſelfe, though it abide in thee, yet thou knoweſt it raigneth not, becauſe thou fighteſt againſt it, and againſt the euill brood of it, with ſighes and groanes, with confeſſion and griefe, with requeſts and prayers, and with daily renewed ſupplications. Say vnto thy ſelfe; I know, and God knoweth, that my cenſoriouſneſſe, my dulneſſe in priuate duties, mine often careleſnes of mine heart, and looſeneſſe of the inward man, my vaine-gloriouſneſſe, my ſlipping againe and againe into the ſame ſinne, and other fruites of diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling within me; that theſe, and all theſe are too rife: but withall, that they are felt, that they are marked, that they are confeſſed, that they are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and that they doe daily driue mee to my knees, and make me come vnto God, with humble intreaty for mercy through his onely Sonne; and therefore I am ſure, that hypocriſie raigneth not, but that truth preuaileth, and therefore I am a true Chriſtian, and ſo I will take my ſelfe to be, and will with all my ſoule praiſe him, that hath made mee ſuch; continuing ſtill to ſtriue to grow in ſincerity and truth, that when theſe graces are become ſtronger, they may become alſo more comfortable vnto me. O all yee, whoſe feeble ſpirits are ſhaken with feare, and to whom nothing is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than this thought, that ſure you be but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; and yet you doe bitterly lament the effects of hypocriſie in your ſelues, and deſire nothing in all the world ſo much, as to be found vpright with your God: I pray you confirme your ſoules in peace, and accept the conſolation that the Lord
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20394:54"/>doth offer you. Take your portion of comfort, be knowne to your ſelues to be what you are, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and ſee how great things God hath done for you, in creating a right ſpirit in you. Doe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ioyne with Satan, in belying your ſelues, as you haue a ready too much &amp; often done, to the great hinderance of your ſoules.<note place="margin">Weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too much.</note> Your cuſtome hath been, whenſoeuer your corruptions haue been any thing ſtrongly wrought vpon, when any bad moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been violent, eſpecially if your paſſions in any kinde haue broken foorth to ſome actuall euill; then to fall vpon your ſelues with grieuous accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to take part with the diuell, in ſlaundring your ſelues; then you haue cryed out, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed againſt your ſelues, and ſayd; Sure I am but an hypocrite and a diſſembler, that haue yet ſtill within me ſuch euill thoughts, am ſtill diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with ſuch paſſions, and ſtill drawne to ſuch wicked deedes. But I ſay vnto you, this is no true inference: as the hypocrite in a fit confeſſeth his ſinne, and is ſorry for it, but yet returneth againe to follow it; ſo the true hearted in a fit doth commit ſinne, but againe returneth to abhorre it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his couenant with God of amending it. As the hollow heart, is good in a paſſion; ſo the true hearted may be bad in a paſſion: but looke to the courſe of thy life, to the ſetled purpoſe of thy ſoule, to the eſtabliſhed deſires of thy mind, and ſo long as there is a conſtant ſtriuing againſt all ſinne by ſpirituall weapons, ſo long thou art good before God, and for Gods ſake, and muſt take thy ſelfe to be vpright. The true Chriſtian ſhall neuer gaine
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20394:54"/>any thing, by calling himſelfe an hypocrite,<note place="margin">But this gets them nothing.</note> to ſee his hypocriſie, to lament it, to ſhame himſelfe before God for it; this ſhall much aduantage his ſoule: but to deny the worke of Gods grace in him, and to ranke himſelfe amongſt diſſemblers from whom he alwaies differs as much, as a man that is ſicke of any ſickneſſe, from him that is dead of that ſickneſſe); this doth no good to him, but interrupts his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hinders his humiliation, eſtrangeth him from God, and turneth godly ſorrow for his ſinne, into deſperate ſorrow for the puniſhment of ſinne. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore that there be true Chriſtians in the Church, who yet are not free from manifold weakeneſſes, and grieuous corruptions; and hauing by proofe and triall diſcerned thine owne eſtate, hold faſt that aſſurance, which thine examination hath yeelded, and call not thy ſelfe an hypocrite, though hypocriſie ſhew it ſelfe in thee, ſo long as thou remaineſt conſtant in obſeruing and oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20394:55"/>(I meane his viſible body), therefore muſt wee bee warie, in not truſting all that carry an appearance of goodneſſe, and farre from condemning all as hypocrites, becauſe ſome proue ſo. Firſt then, let the plaine words of Chriſt in this text, aduertiſe vs to put away ſimple and fooliſh credulitie, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all for that they ſeeme; and putting our ſelues into the hands of a man, ſo ſoone as euer any good things appeare in him.<note place="margin">Wee muſt not be lightly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous.</note> Let vs rather vſe all good diſcretion, and bee reſerued from men, vntill by long experience, wee haue gotten very good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their ſinceritie. Our Sauiour hath made himſelfe a patterne to vs of this prudent warineſſe, as well as of all other graces: for many beleeued in him,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. vlt.</note> as <hi>Iohn</hi> tels vs, with whom hee truſted not himſelfe, becauſe he knew what was in man. Wee cannot tell particularly, as he could, what is in the hearts of all thoſe, whoſe countenance is framed to goodneſſe: but yet this we know in generall, that much hollowneſſe is in all, and that many are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether hollow and guilefull; wherefore till long continuance in goodneſſe, till the euident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of truth, and the cleare ſhining of vertue, in the much and often denying of themſelues, haue verified and approued the ſoundnes of mens hearts;<note place="margin">But hold our ſelues in ſuch tearmes, that men may not hurt vs if they would.</note> wee muſt hold our ſelues in ſuch termes with them, that they may not haue power to hurt vs (through our ouer-ſpeedy openneſſe towards them), euen though they ſhould afterwards grow ſo naught, as to deſire our hurt. I meane not, that any man ſhould bee bold to conclude againſt his brother, ſure hee but diſſembleth, and I will not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20394:55"/>truſt him. Nay, we ſhould feare to conceiue ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of any man: for euen a true Chriſtian may giue ſhrewd ſignes ſometimes of hollowneſſe: but my meaning is, that we ſhould thinke and hope the beſt, and be well perſwaded of euery man, whoſe outſide giueth vs cauſe of a good opinion; but yet ſo, as ſtill to remember, that wee are not able to ſearch the heart, and that guile and hollowneſſe may goe very farre, and therefore not to aduenture too farre vpon them, in hope that they be ſuch, as will neuer deceiue vs. Thou knoweſt not, that ſuch a man is a diſſembler, therefore thinke well of him. Thou knoweſt that there is a poſſibility he may be a diſſembler, therfore come not within his danger; giue him no ſuch aduantage, through laying open thy ſelfe vnto him, that if hee ſhould proue guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, thou mighteſt be hurt by him. Credulitie is the fault of honeſt hearts; becauſe they bee ſingle themſelues, they looke to find all like themſelues: but Chriſts words ſhould giue vs warning, to try before we truſt. If any man ſay, that this retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will cut off the practice and exerciſe of all Chriſtian communion betwixt the members of Chriſts body: I anſwere,<note place="margin">Which will nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</note> hee ſaith amiſſe that ſo ſpeaketh; a man may doe many (and almoſt any) office of Chriſtian charitie, to thoſe with whom he liueth, and yet hold himſelfe in ſuch euen termes with them, that though they ſhould prooue falſe brethren, yet he ſhal not receiue any hurt by them. There be many acts of godly ſocietie, which may be practiſed without any perill, eſpecially in the peaceable times of the Church, and theſe (nothing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20394:56"/>hinders, but that) wee may indifferently exerciſe towards all: but if at any time ſome ſtormes ariſe, we muſt beware before whom, and towards whom, we carry our ſelues ſo, that they may hurt vs, if they liſt. Take heed whom thou truſteſt with thy goods, whom with thy name, whom with thy ſafetie, and to whom thou ſo farre ingageſt thy ſelfe, that hee may (if hee will) deceiue thee, betray thee, moleſt thee. There be ſome ſo true hearted, that the world ſhall ſooner remoue out of its place, then that they will prooue falſe. There be others, that will quickly change their hue, and be foes, in ſtead of their ſhewes of brotherly loue. Pray to God to giue thee vnderſtanding, to walke wiſely towards them that are within, as well as towards them that are without.</p>
                     <p>And if any man deſire to receiue information of the ſureſt notes of truth,<note place="margin">Notes by which we may beſt diſcerne of another mans integrity</note> that are diſcernable to others, &amp; in others, let him marke theſe two things well. The more humble any man is, the leſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to put forth himſelfe, and to ſhew himſelfe, and the more he can deny himſelfe, and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe louing and pittifull towards thoſe, that yet ſeeme farre from goodneſſe; the more ſoundneſſe and truth doe lodge in his boſome: but hee that is apt to ſet out himſelfe, and cannot brooke another, that goeth not ſo farre as himſelfe: that man doe thou ſuſpect, and from him be thou reſerued. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and meekeneſſe in ones carriage, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient waiting for them, that are not yet eſcaped out of Satans toyles, are (mee thinketh) the ſureſt and cleareſt meanes of diſcouering the truth of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20394:56"/>man. For hypocriſie in ſpight of it ſelfe, will ſhew it ſelfe proud and cenſorious, and bitter: but truth, euen when it intendeth no ſuch matter, will ſhew it ſelfe humble and lowly, and gentle-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, conſidering it ſelfe how bad once it was, and how much heereafter it may be ouertaken.</p>
                     <p>To conclude then; ſome be falſe brethren:<note place="margin">Truſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaſt that are moſt deſirous to bee truſted, and angry if they be not truſted.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truſt not all too farre, that carry themſelues for a time, as if a man might truſt them; and truſt them leaſt, that ſeeme moſt deſirous to be truſted. Againe, doe not condemne all of falſehood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a number diſcouer their guilt daily. When many of thoſe that ſeemed leaders of the Army of Chriſtians, fall off from their good beginnings, and caſt away the very ſhewes of goodneſſe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning openly profane or worldly, and perhaps alſo bitter againſt thoſe, that ſeeme to be ſuch, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues once ſeemed.<note place="margin">Diſlike not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety for their ſakes that proue diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers.</note> Let no man take offence at theſe ſtumbling blockes: let no man hence enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a thought of diſlike againſt Pietie and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor an hard conceit of thoſe, that yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in good courſes. Such terrible examples ſhould make vs feare our ſelues, and flie to heauen for diuine ſuſtentation, they ſhould not make vs reiect the loue of godlineſſe, and account all rotten branches, becauſe ſome are ſo. Hath not Chriſt told vs before-hand, that ſo it will be, that when we finde it ſo to be, we may not be offended, as he tells his Diſciples in another caſe. The fooliſh world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtumbleth exceedingly at the ſlips, faults, and imperfections of Gods true-hearted children; and becauſe hee ſees faults in them, that beare before
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20394:57"/>them a forwardneſſe in religion, he condemnes them all for groſſe diſſemblers, and cannot away with theſe ſmooth-faced hypocrites. But if at any time ſome prooue ranke hypocrites, he takes that as a warrant for his tongue to out-laſh againſt all, ſaying, that ſurely the beſt of them is no better. But how could they be ſo fooliſh, but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in folly, and are glad to make themſelues ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in euill; and to confirme their inbred ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of pietie, by turning all occurrents to that purpoſe? were it not (I ſay) for this malitious blindneſſe of theirs, how could they be ſo fooliſh, as not to haue learned of our Sauiours moſt plaine words, that in him there will be fruitleſſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that muſt bee cut off, and caſt out, as well as fruitfull, that will continue and encreaſe in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe? Would any but a very blocke, or a blind man, ſtumble at a blocke, that is plainely ſhewed vnto him, and warning hath often beene giuen him, that it will ſurely bee caſt in his way? would any but a man voyd of all vnderſtanding, abhorre all the Apoſtles, becauſe <hi>Iudas</hi> turned traytor? I pray you therefore, ſo many of you as ſhall liue to ſee ſuch miſerable examples, that you draw good, and not euill concluſions from the falls, reuolts, and back-ſlidings of other men, and of hypocrites. Say thou, I am ſure Chriſt hath good ſheepe, as well as goates; and though ſuch and ſuch haue manifeſted their guilefulneſſe, by forſaking the former pathes of righteouſneſſe, wherein they appeared to walke; yet I will not be hardly conceited of any body elſe, for their ſakes. In this caſe the prouerbe ought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20394:57"/>to be hearkened vnto, that tels vs, Euery Horſe muſt carry his owne burden. In truth, hee that ſtands ſo ſlenderly affected, either to goodnes and piety it ſelfe, or to the ſeruants and followers of ſo noble a miſſtreſſe, as piety is; that becauſe of the wickedneſſe, and out-ſtrayings, and finall reuolts of ſome of thoſe, that ſeemed once to attend vpon her, and to be admitted into her traine; therefore he cares not for pietie it ſelfe, nor will euer thinke well of any of thoſe, that weare here cloath hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he (I ſay) that ſtands ſo ſlenderly affected to Wiſdome and her retinue, ſhall be ſure, neuer to want occaſion of imboldening himſelfe in ſinne, and of being more and more eſtranged from that, the entertaining of which, is the onely way to make him happie. Yea verily, hee whom the back-ſliding of ſeeming Chriſtians, doth driue to ſo much madneſſe, as that he can turne ſo lamentable a ſpectacle to no better a purpoſe, then to triumph and exult ouer all, and barke againſt al, and vpbrade all with ſuch euill examples: diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe plainely not to hate the ſinne of the back-ſlider which hee lately fell into, but the very ſhewes of goodneſſe wherein once he walked, and from which he is faine. In a word, he that ſcornes pietie and religion, and thoſe that follow after it, becauſe diuers turne taile, and prooue notably wicked at end, ſhewes himſelfe plainely to be voyd of all religion, &amp; all piety. When the true ſeruants of God doe ſee and heare ſuch tidings, it grieueth their ſoules, it maketh them mourne in ſecret, and pray in ſecret, and fall a freſh to examine and trie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20394:58"/>themſelues, leſt they alſo ſhould be in like manner ouertaken. But he that fleereth, and ieſteth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulteth, and ſcorneth, and caſts the dung of one, in the face of others, and would faine blemiſh all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſſe, by the ſtaines and faults of thoſe that once ſeemed religious: hath nothing in him but malice and bitterneſſe, and the very ſpirit of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. Beware therefore of making thy ſelfe appeare ſtarke naught, by ſo ſtumbling at the breaking out of ſome other mans long hidden naughtineſſe.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND ſo much bee ſpoken of the diſtribution of branches into two kinds: Wee proceede now to conſider the difference of the branches: for in that they bee branches they both concurre: but herein they differ manifeſtly, that the one is, the other is not fruitfull. Obſerue then from theſe words of our Sauiour, another point, that fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the true note of difference betwixt the true Chriſtian, and the hypocrite. As a man differs from a beaſt by reaſon; a beaſt from a plant; by ſence; a plant from a ſtone, by life or vegetation; ſo a good Chriſtian from an hypocrite, by fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. This is the moſt plaine, ſure, ſenſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20394:58"/>and (as they call it) the very ſpecifical marke of diſtinction, betwixt the ſound profeſſor and the falſe, that the one beareth fruit, the other doth not beare fruit in the Vine. Where the holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God haue ſuch power, as to work obedience in the whole couerſation, this is fruitefulneſſe, and here is truth: where they doe not bring forth this effect, this is fruitleſneſſe, and here is guile. In a word, all true Chriſtians are fruitfull, and none but they: all diſſemblers are fruitleſſe, and none but they. This point is abundantly confirmed in the parable of the ſower, in which of foure grounds, one alone was good, and that fruitfull; as for the bad grounds, the firſt did not beare ſo much as a blade;<note place="margin">Mat. 13.1. &amp;c.</note> the other two did indeed put out a little greenenes, but it was like the corne vpon the houſe top, which withereth or euer it be ripe, and of which the mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er filleth not his lap; onely the good ground did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the labour of the husbandman with a liberall harueſt of ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, ſome hundred fold. So in the words of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.7.8.</note> the ground that bringeth forth fruite meete for the dreſſer, is bleſſed, but that that bringeth forth briars and thornes, is neere vnto curſing, whoſe end is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24.</note> And in more plaine termes our Sauiour ſaith, that hee which heareth his words and doth them (this is fruitfulneſſe) doth build vpon a rocke (this is an effect of truth): but he that heareth and doth them not (that is, to bee vnfruitfull), doth build vpon the ſand; that is, is but an hypocrite, and ſhall haue his building tumbling downe.</p>
                     <p>The truth of this point will further appeare, if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20394:59"/>we conſider the cauſes and effects of fruitfulneſſe. The cauſes of it, are the ſactifying Spirit of God dwelling in the ſoule; and the Word of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into an honeſt heart. No man bringeth forth fruit, but he vpon whom the holy Ghoſt hath come downe, to beget him againe, and to make him a new creature in Chriſt Ieſus: for a tree muſt firſt liue, afore it beare; and no man is vnfruitfull, but becauſe hee is deſtitute of the worke of Gods ſpirit, ſo forming him into a new creature, becauſe hee hath neglected or reſiſted it. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whoſoeuer hath the ſpirit of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, is a true Chriſtian; he that hath it not, is none. Wherefore from ones being fruitfull, or not fruitfull, it may be infallibly concluded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be true or hollow. Againe, no man brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth the fruit of good liuing, vntill the word of God haue entred into his heart, and taken deepe roote in the very bottome of his ſoule: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, where this fruit doth not ſhew it ſelfe, there the Word of God did neuer enter into the ſoule, neither was ſoundly rooted therein; and it is doubtleſſe, that if GODS Word haue copious dwelling in vs, we be true Chriſtians; if not, we bee but diſſemblers. Wherefore the bearing, or not bearing of fruit, is a ſound proofe of truth, or want of truth. Againe, looke we to the effects of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or its abſence, and it will vndeniably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that theſe two doe beſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſincere and hollow hearted: for the ground that bringeth fruit, muſt obtaine a bleſſing. The reward of a good life here, is eternall life hereafter:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20394:59"/>but the end of the ground that beareth not fruit, is curſing and burning; and euill-led life, ſhall end in death eternall. Now none can be ſaued but the true Chriſtian; and no Chriſtian is damned, but the falſe: wherefore from this point, the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and formall difference of Chriſtians (the branches in Chriſt) muſt be taken.</p>

But more particularly, that you may be thorowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this point. Fruitefulneſſe muſt bee ſet forth vnto you, in the matter, motiue, end, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

                     <p>For the firſt of theſe,<note place="margin">The matter of fruitfulneſſe.</note> the matter of fruitfulneſſe is, <hi>A deſire and endeauour, to know and to doe the whole will of God, reuealed in his Word.</hi> Euery word that wee haue vſed in this deſcription, would be marked and conſiderd of.<note place="margin">A deſire.</note> Firſt, I call it <hi>a deſire,</hi> a firme and ſtedfaſt bending of the will and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the heart, to the thing deſired.

Hee would be void of al ſin, he would be rich in euery good work, he would haue euery thing within him, and euery thing that comes from him, perfectly conformable to the will of God, and acceptable to his Maieſtie. In the depth of his ſoule theſe hearty wiſhes are found continually working;<note place="margin">Pſal 119.5 10.32.57.93.106 173.40.</note> 
                        <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keepe thy ſtatutes! O let mee not wander from thy commandements: I will runne the way of thy commandements: I haue ſaid, that I will keepe thy words: I will neuer forget thy precepts: I haue ſworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements. I haue choſen the way of truth. I long for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20394:60"/>thy precepts:</hi> and many ſuch like. This is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his will, theſe the determinations, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, concluſions of his ſoule; thus hee ſaith to, and within himſelfe, that doubtleſſe he will depart from the pathes of wickedneſſe, and that hee will walke in the waies of righteouſnes: and thus is he buſied in renewing and eſtabliſhing the purpoſes of his ſoule, to walke with his God. And though he find no meanes to performe according to his deſire, yet ſtill his deſire ſtandeth to the law of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And this deſire being a true and ſetled deſire,<note place="margin">And endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> muſt needs be ſeconded with endeauour. It is not a poore, faint, ſluggiſh, wiſhing and woulding, by which a man (as it were betwixt ſleeping and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) doth thinke, twere well if I did, and ſure I will, and I would if I could, as a ſluggard lieth ſtretched in his bed, and faintly wiſheth, O that I could ariſe! It is not (I ſay) ſuch a feeble, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, auert, deſire, as this (which is but (as one would ſay) the tenth part of the conſent of the will, to the thing willed): but it is a deſire ſo mighty, and effectuall, as doth bring forth an endeauour. It makes a man put forth himſelfe, to eſſect the thing deſired. Hee wiſheth to obey, as a reſolute ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wiſheth victory, ſo as he will fight for it, and draw his weapon, and meete his enemy in the face, and hazard limme and life, and giue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue blowes, and leaue nothing vndone, that his wit ſerues him to thinke of, for the atchieuement of victory. A coward alſo would faine diuide the ſpoile, and feede himſelfe with the fatneſſe of a good booty: but his wiſhes do not diſpearce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20394:61"/>into his hands and legges, nor ſtirre vp his ſpirits and his limmes to be entring battaile, and to ioyne hand to hand with the foe: ſo a good mans deſire of obedience, ſets his head, and heart, and hand on worke, to the attainement of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He thinkes; Ah that I could be good accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods commandement! And further hee thinketh; What may I doe to get power againſt ſuch a ſinne? to attaine ſtrength to doe ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? And when hee ſees what is to be done, he ſets about it, he calles vpon himſelfe, he calles vpon God, he vrgeth his owne heart, hee entreates the Lord Ieſus for helpe, he blames himſelfe, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes himſelfe, hee inforceth vpon himſelfe the remembrance of Gods commandements, Gods iudgements,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 25 9.48.</note> Gods promiſes, and as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, he lifts vp his hands to the Law of God which hee hath loued. He is buſie in labouring to obey, and a man that liues with him, may euen perceiue in him, and he, in himſelfe, a ſtrift this way. For in truth as there is a great difference betwixt luſting to be rich, and labouring for wealth: ſo betwixt a bare luſting to be good, and endeauouring after goodneſſe. The ſluggard would bee content to take wealth, if he could find it vnder his foote, or if with little adoe hee could entreat it to fall into his lap; yea, ſometimes when hee wants money, or cloathes, or foode, and is pinched with neede, hee hath a kind of angry eagerneſſe after it, and hee would as leife as his life, haue ſo good a liuing as his neighbour hath: but hee cannot ſhake off ſleepe in a cold morning, hee can endure no ſweates: hee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20394:61"/>can endure no ſweate, he loues not to riſe betimes, and ſet to worke, he cannot trauell, he cannot take paines. Not ſo the good husband; for he thinkes of his buſineſſe, whither he may goe, what he may doe, what times he muſt obſerue for the getting of a ſhilling; and accordingly takes thoſe times, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth thoſe buſineſſes, and goes to ſuch places; and neyther heate, nor cold, nor wet, nor dry, nor night, nor darkeneſſe ſhall hinder him, but he will goe forward with thoſe things, which are requiſite for his thriuing. Euen ſo the fooliſh man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, could find in his heart to leaue ſuch a ſinne, and to doe ſuch good duties. O it were very well if he had ſuch vertues, and were rid of ſuch vices! and what a good turne had hee, if he could doe, as ſuch and ſuch: and in a twinge of his conſcience, or in a fit, when he is told of heauen, hee could bee content to leape out of his skin to get heauen, and to get out of hell: but after his fit is ouer, he cannot away with this confeſſing of his ſinnes in ſecret, with this rending of his ſoule, with this earneſt contending with God, and with this croſſing of his owne nature, and fighting againſt the luſts of his fleſh, euen with this labouring for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God aboue all things. But the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſtands otherwiſe affected, he muſeth of the way and meanes of getting grace, he thinketh ſeriouſly what is to be done, for the beating downe of ſuch a vice, and building vp of ſuch a vertue: hee beateth vpon his owne heart, all ſuch reaſons as hee can bring, to fix his will in a reſolution of doing good, leauing euill; hee taketh paines with calling hard
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20394:62"/>vpon God; takes paines in checking and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in prouoking and ſtirring vp himſelfe; in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to lament and bewayle, to hate and deteſt his ſinne; and to worke in himſelfe earneſt ſorrow, and ſound griefe for ſinne; and thinkes not much, euen to weary and toyle himſelfe in theſe ſpirituall labours. Hee plowes his heart, hee ſowes in the Word, be ſeekes for ſhowres of grace, hee weedes his heart, hee breakes the clods of his heart. Thus he ſets himſelfe to taske, and is a right husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his owne ſoule.</p>
                     <p>Further, the thing about which his deſires and endeauours are conuerſant,<note place="margin">About the will of God.</note> is the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his Word: not the will of men, not the ſecret and hidden will of GOD, nor a ſuppoſed imaginary will of God; but that ſelfe-ſame will of God, which is deliuered vnto him in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles: for ſo ſaith <hi>Dauid, His delight is in the Law of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2. Pſal. 119.105.</note> And againe, <hi>Thy word is a Lanthorne to my feet, and a light to my paths.</hi> He lookes to that which is reuealed, and deſires to be wiſe, according to that which is written, and not aboue it: his deſires and labours are limited by the manifeſtation of Gods will.</p>
                     <p>In things tendred to the thoughts of his mind, hee demaundeth how it is written?<note place="margin">Reuealed in Scriptures.</note> and how doe I reade? ſo farre (and no further) ſtooping, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as he findeth diuine authority, with Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and Apoſtolicall teſtimony, to call for yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. I haue walked in thy truth,<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.3.</note> ſaith <hi>Dauid.</hi> He knowes, that what the Lord hath commended to his Church, by thoſe principall Paſtours of his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20394:62"/>Church, the Prophets and Apoſtles, that is Gods truth; and therefore he ſubdues his reaſon and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections vnto it. But if any man will bring any thing to him, and preſſe it as neceſſary to ſaluation, which hath not the ſtampe of diuine inſpiration; he knowes not how to ſubmit his conſcience to ſuch baſeneſſe, as to yeeld it ſelfe to any other, than the royall ſoueraignty of the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; like a right good ſubiect, and withall noble and ingenuous: that as he cannot be induced to with-draw his necke from his Princes yoke, ſo can he by no meanes indure the burden of an vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Scepter; and therefore he had rather die with the honorable liberty of a ſubiect of the Lord, than liue a ſlaue, inthralled to the tyranny of an vſurping creature.</p>
                     <p>Now this will of God he ſtriueth both to know,<note place="margin">Both to know and doe the ſame.</note> and alſo to doe. Not to know alone, nor to doe alone, but to know and doe both: euen to doe out of know ledge, is the marke that his indeuours aime at. An hypocrite ſeparates theſe two things; hee would know, but regardeth not to practiſe; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits GODS Word into his head willingly, and with applauſe in moſt things; but into his heart, and into his life hee doth not admit it. Neyther doth he therefore ſtudy to vnderſtand, that he may bee ruled by the light hee hath gotten, but alone, that he may make himſelfe a teacher of others, or a carper at others, and a well applauded diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer before others. He hath lame feete, though hee haue a ſeeing eye, and neuer cares to goe, where hee ſees his duety leadeth him. Thus the forward
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20394:63"/>diſſembler; and quite contrarily, the ordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall man, he ſeemeth to be all for doing, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, little caring to know or vnderſtand; as if a man ſhould talke of diſpatching his worke in the darke without a candle, doubtleſſe this worke would be but bunglingly performed: but the Chriſtian deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to rectifie his life by knowledge, to guide his feete by his eye, and his eye by the lanthorne of the Word, that ſo hee may neither haue a fruitleſſe knowledge, nor a blinde practiſe, but may attaine the bleſſing that our Sauiour pronounceth, ſaying; Now you know theſe things,<note place="margin">Iohn 13.17.</note> happy are ye if you do them. And this is the matter of a good life, a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will and endeauour to know, and doe the will of God, ſet downe in Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Let vs acquaint you with the moouing cauſe thereof,<note place="margin">The motiue of fruitfulneſſe is loue to God. Iohn 14.15.</note> which muſt bee the loue of God in Chriſt, according as our Sauiour himſelfe aſſureth vs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>If yee loue me keepe my commandements.</hi> In like maner the Apoſtle telling vs, that faith muſt worke by loue;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.14, 15</note> and ſaying of himſelfe, that the loue of God conſtrayned him to preach the Goſpell: for thus did he iudge, that ſeeing one died for al, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all were dead; and that hee dyed for all, that they which liue, ſhould hereafter liue, not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but to him that dyed for them. The holy Ghoſt at what time it incorporateth the Chriſtian into Chriſts body, and maketh him a true branch of this Vine, doth ground in his ſoule a ſetled and firme perſwaſion, of the vnſpeakeable loue of God vnto him, in Chriſt his Mcdiatour. And though he haue not alwaies a ſence of this loue, yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20394:63"/>of it, doth alwayes take ſuch deepe roote in him, that it euidently ſhewes it ſelfe, in drawing his ſoule to be one with God, making his heart ſtill to hang towards him, and to bee affected with great good will vnto him. Now loue is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that tendeth to vnite the things loued; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be none vnion betwixt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Creator, vnleſſe the Creature do euen reſigne and yeeld vp his will to Gods will, to bee carried, mooued, and guided by it: hence it is, that the ſoule louing God, muſt needs ſubiect its will vnto him; and therefore be carefull to know and do his will, becauſe it is his will, that he ſhould ſo endeuour to know and doe. And ſo is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian heart allured forward to obedience: for wee loue God, becauſe he loued vs firſt,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.19.</note> faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and then muſt our loue needs bring foorth this obedience. And this thing is of ſo abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, in the point of good liuing, that without it, no ſeeming goodneſſe can bee acceptable vnto GOD.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.2.</note> For ſo we haue the Apoſtle plainly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto vs, that though a man giue his body to be burned; and though he giue all his ſubſtance to the poore, yet if he haue not loue, all is of no worth or reckoning. Whatſoeuer therefore doth not ariſe out of his fountaine, and grow from this roote, it is not to bee called fruit, vnleſſe you will meane rotten and worme caten fruit. And we may ſay aſſuredly, that vnleſſe the thing inducing vs to the care of knowing and doing Gods will, bee a deare and hearty affection which wee beare in our ſoules to him, out of a perſwaſion that we haue, of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20394:64"/>the great and tender compaſſion that hee bare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in Chriſt, and an apprehenſion of the infinite riches of his grace and wiſedome, ſhewed in his Sonne; our indeauour is not accepted, neyther can be called holy. But the people of GOD, doe find themſelues ſo linked and tied vnto God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that, his moſt wiſe, gracious, and fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing with them in his ſonne, and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite excellencies, which from the ſight of this goodneſſe, they begin to diſcerne in him; that out of the ſweete and gentle motions of this loue, they are fully reſolued to obey him. Thus there is a joynt operation of faith, and loue in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it being vtterly impoſſible, that the creature ſhould loue God, but out of ſome true perſwaſion of Gods loue to him. Wherefore how godly or good ſoeuer any mans life be, in ſhew and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; if the maine motiue to that goodneſſe bee the loue of men alone, or the loue of himſelfe, or any ſuch like, and not the loue of God, ſpringing from an inward, and grounded apprehenſion of Gods grace towards him, in the face of Chriſt; it is not to be called Goodneſſe indeed, neither is ſo in Gods account. Let vs inſtance in one or two particulars. A man meeting with a miſerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is liberall towards him with money for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. The thing that induced him thereto, was the entreaty of the party, or a kind of naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, or the labour of ſome friend: but he neuer conſidered, that God (who ſo infinitely loued him, as to make his onely Sonne poore, that hee might be made rich) hath required ſuch duties of loue
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20394:64"/>and bounty at his hands, towards his brethren for his ſake; neyther did prouoke and ſtirre vp himſelfe to exerciſe this bounty, with lifting vp his mind to Gods commandement and good pleaſure, and to the goodneſſe and kindneſſe of God towards him (to whom it were a ſhame of all ſhames for him to deny ſo ſmall a matter, as the beſtowing of a little pittance of his owne wealth at his appoyntment). This almeſ-deed, this act of liberalitie, is not a fruit of piety; it is not a fruit of Faith, it is not a fruit of Chriſtianity, it is not in him, and to him a good deede, or an act of obodience to the Lord: but another meeting with the like perſon, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noked by the forenamed meditations, to helpe and comfort him, and by the ſtirring of ſuch thoughts in his mind, hath his heart inclined to giue him what hee needeth: or if the ſodaineneſſe of their meeting, or ſome other like occaſion, cauſe, that hee hath not theſe thoughts preſently ſtirring in his minde, yet they haue been in him often before, to beget in him an habite of liberality: this now is a fruit of grace, this is to bring forth fruit in Chriſt, this is a true good worke, and ſuch as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe accepteth, and accounteth good. So in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church to heare the Word, or to receiue the Sacraments, in labouring in a mans calling, in doing of iuſtice, and in all other particular points of goodneſſe; if we be not moued to theſe by loue to God, in obedience to his Commandement, out of faith to his gradious promiſes in Chriſt, but by conſiderations taken meerely from our ſelues, whether in regard of the preſent life, or that that is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20394:65"/>to come, we cannot ſay, that wee be fruitfull bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, neither doe wee indeed ſerue God in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but when our minde doth lift it ſelfe vp to God, and by the conſideration of his good will and pleaſure, doth ſtirre vp it ſelfe to doe good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee know, hee would haue it to be done; whom we ſo loue, that we cannot but deſire, that his will ſhould be ſatis fied and accompliſhed (for he that loueth any perſon, doth alſo carefully binde himſelfe, to fulfill his will whom he loueth; vnleſſe his will be to haue that done, which would be for his owne hurt, which can neuer befall the Lord of heauen, becauſe of his perfect and infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome): when (I ſay) our mindes do thus ſtirre vp themſelues to doe good, or auoyde euill, then doe wee truly ſerue God, and this is ſuch obedience, as God doth take pleaſure in, as it were in grapes of good taſte, that grow vpon the Vine of his owne planting.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">The end of fruitfulneſſe, is Gods glory.</note> the end of our doing Gods will, muſt be Gods glory, or (which is all one) that wee may pleaſe him; for in ſeeking to pleaſe him, wee glorifie him: and theſe two things are alwayes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> So the Apoſtle directeth, ſaying; <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoener you do,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.12.</note> 
                        <hi>let all be done to the glorie of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>That we may be to the praiſe of his glorie.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 4.1.</note> 
                        <hi>You haue receiued of vs, how ye ought to walke and to pleaſe God.</hi> The maine ſcope and drift you ſee, of all our actions muſt be this, that we may doe that which is good in Gods fight, and ſo content and ſatisfie him, and witneſſe our high and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſteeme of him, and teſtifie our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20394:65"/>of his infinite and incomparable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The principall thing that muſt ſtand before our eyes, alluring and inuiting vs to the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med care, of doing and knowing the will of God, muſt be this, that wee may honour and pleaſe our Maker. Not to pleaſe men, not to winne fauour, credit, wealth in the world; nay, nor to get eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happines to our ſelues: none of all theſe (I ſay) muſt be the chiefe ſcope of our obedience, but that wee may bring ſome honour to him, to whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all his creatures ought, in reaſon, to addict themſelues, and that wee might content him, whoſe content all things ſhould ſeeke to worke, becauſe all things are from him: for the Lord taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in thoſe that feare him; he deſireth that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould turne and liue; he wiſheth, O that my people would hearken! their prayers be as incenſe in his ſight; their obedience, a ſacrifice of a ſweete ſmelling ſauour; and their Almeſ-deede, an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with which hee is well pleaſed: and by doing of theſe things, and auoyding the contrary, is the Lord highly honored, in that hereby he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords; and we doe make profeſſion of our eſteeming him, the Soueraigne Lord and Commaunder of our ſelues, and of all creatures. And this is the very white (as it were), at which all our obedience muſt be leuelled. Not but that there are inferiour ends, reſpecting our ſelues, and our owne good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we may looke, and by which we may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to doe good: but the chiefe thing of all, and that which muſt ſway vs moſt of all, muſt be this,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20394:66"/>that God may be pleaſed and honoured by vs. A man may lawfully purpoſe, to gratifie a friend in ſome good deeds, to procure ſome temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to himſelfe by other good deeds; and in all to further and worke out his owne ſaluation. But the maine and chiefe end, the vtmoſt, the vpſhot of all the reſt; that, that his mind muſt looke to, in, and aboue all the reſt, and make more care of than all the reſt, and which muſt be of ſuch power, that it would draw him to obedience; though all the reſt were abſent: this ſupreame and moſt potent end, muſt be the forenamed things, the pleaſing and glorifying of God. Euen as a good ſeruant, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſeruice to his Maſter, hopeth and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to doe himſelfe good, by being capable of his Maſters bounty, and receiuing liberall wages from him, whom he knowes to be ſo good, that hee will not deale niggardly with any of his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: but the ſpeciall thing he aimes at, is, that he may aduantage his Maſter, and pleaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, by doing his buſineſſe: for hee that doth chiefely aime at wages (in ſo much I meane, that were not that wages an attractiue, he would not do the ſeruice which he doth) cannot indeed be ſaid ſo much to ſerue his maſter, as himſelf. So the ſeruants of God may, and do aime at their own eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and at the obtaining of the bleſſings of GOD which hee hath promiſed: but there is an higher thing, and a further matter, at which they looke more directly, &amp; whereto they bend their thoughts more ſpecially, and that is the pleaſing and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of him their Lord and Maſter, whom they

                        <hi>that thy Sonne may alſo glorifie thee.</hi> Loe, the firſt thing hee looked at, was the glory of his Father; and his owne glory was reſpected by him none otherwiſe, than as a fruit, or meanes of the glory which his Father ſhould haue by him: for ſo that is truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the principall end, which of it ſelfe, though all the reſt were ſet aſide, would allure a man to doe a thing, although hee may perhaps the rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo worke, by the comming betwixt of ſome other inferiour and ſubordinate end: as the chiefe end of a tradeſ-mans going to the faire or market, is to buy and ſell, though he may perhaps the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily goe to meete ſome friend there; for his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would draw him thither, though his friend ſhould not happily come thither. So ought the glory of God to carry ſo great a ſway in our ſoules, that in regard of it chiefely, we doe as we doe in a godly conuerſation; ſtanding ſo reſolued, that we would carry our ſelues in that holy manner, euen ſimply for the glory ſake of GOD, though our ſelues ſhould not attaine happineſſe thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now that hee hath pleaſed inſeparably to conioyne our felicitie and his owne glory, wee doe ſo much the rather, and ſo much the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and thankefully performe ſuch obedience vnto him. But as for thoſe worldly and baſe ends of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, gaine, and the like, wee ſhould euen quite and cleane neglect them; vnleſſe it be ſo farre foorth alone, as they be referrable to that higheſt end, in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20394:67"/>that wee may be the better able to attayne that by meanes of them. This is in very truth to deny our ſelues, and not to liue to our ſelues, but to liue to him: and ſo wee ought (as it were) to forget our ſelues, and to ſequeſter our thoughts from our ſelues, ſending them vp ſwiftly and plentifully to him, who is infinitely better than our ſelues, and than all creatures: for what more reaſonable, and equall, and conuenient, than that his glory ſhould be preferred aboue all things, in whom, and from whom all things haue their beeing and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And theſe be the cauſes of fruitfulneſſe, the matter, motiue and end.</p>

It ſufficeth not to yeeld vnto him in a few things, nor in all things, except one; but vniuerſally in all things, without any exception, muſt we ſubmit our ſelues to him, in the deſire and endeauour of our ſoules. A good man may bee ignorant of many things that God reuealeth, but he muſt be willing and ready to know his whole will. Hee may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe come ſhort of doing many things which hee knoweth; but he muſt purpoſe, labour and ſtriue to doe all things, that ſo hee may ſhew himſelfe a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20394:67"/>true and abſolute inferiour to the Lord. For God cannot in any thing be deceiued, or commaund a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in any matter. For men, it is lawfull to deny ſubiection to them in many things, becauſe they may miſtake and erre in many things, and becauſe their power and authority is limited: but GODS will is without all reſtraint and limitation to be yeelded vnto, becauſe he hath a full and perfect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty ouer vs. And indeed no man is mooued by the loue of God, or aymeth at his glory in any thing, vnleſſe he be vniuerſally obedient; ſo that is but a counterfeit obedience, which is not generall. Here is no place left for picking or chuſing, neither may we lawfully refuſe his commaundement in any particular, but muſt ſay, as once the Iſraelites did; <hi>Whatſoeuer the Lord our God commaundeth,</hi>

                     <p>Agayne,<note place="margin">Conſtancy.</note> conſtancy muſt accompany our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we muſt not walk in this way for a ſpirt, a litle, now and then, and afterwards giue ouer: but we muſt proceede in a ſettled courſe, without any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer, or deſiſting. A good man followeth goodneſſe, as a Tradeſ-man doth his trade; hee is at it, to day, and to morrow, and the third day, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20394:68"/>all the dayes of his life: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, I will keepe them to the end.<note place="margin">Pſal 119.33.112.</note> And againe, <hi>I haue inclined mine heart to perfor me thy ſtatutes alwayes, euen to the end.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe meditation is in the Law of God day and night.</hi> The moſt painefull labourer hath now and then a fit at play, and ſometimes hee meeteth with an holy-day: but vſually (though not ſtill with the like intention of paines, yet in a ſetled courſe) he is found in doing his worke and buſines. So a Chriſtian man is not alwayes a like earneſt; yea, ſometimes he makes indeed an holy-day, or a loytering idle day (for which hee doth well ſhent himſelfe afterwards), but yet vſually and in a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt courſe he followes after goodneſſe, and is ſtill ſtill applying this great and neceſſary worke of a godly life: for God who hath appointed him this taske, doth not allow him any diſcontinuance. And this is fruitfulnes, or a good life, when a man, out of a perſwaſion of Gods tender loue vnto him in Ieſus Chriſt, doth intertaine in his ſoule ſuch an carneſt and hearty loue vnto God, as maketh him carefull to pleaſe and honour him, by continuall ſtriuing to know what is his good, holy and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table will, and framing himſelfe in all things to doe what he biddeth, (leaue the contrary), without any finall ſurceaſing: ſo that though he ſlacke his pace now and then, and ſome dulnes do creep vpon him, yet he quickens himſelfe, and ſets to it againe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing neuer to giue ouer quite, ſo long as life la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth. This is to liue as beſeemeth the Goſpell of Chriſt; this is to heare the Word of God, and doe it; this is to walke in the truth of God; this is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20394:68"/>better than all ſacrifices. And ſo haue wee ſufficiently explicated the point: wee muſt now make ſome vſe of it.</p>

Aime they at this? Buſie they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues about this? To pleaſe the liuing God, the Author of thy life, by knowing and doing his moſt righteous will?

Wherefore conſider aduiſedly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere truly; Can thine heart ſay in Gods hearing, that theſe things are found in thee? or that they are not found? Doubtleſſe brethren, it is as poſſible
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20394:70"/>for vs to tell, and that certainely and infallibly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we follow the trade of godlineſſe, as any other manuall trade or occupation. Hee that tills the ground, he that tendeth cattell, hee that is a Smith, or a Carpenter, or the like; I ſay, euery one of theſe can tell, that he followes ſuch a Calling: one can ſay; Mine hand is often at the Plow, and I am ſtill about the husbanding of my ground, I am thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſowing, of reaping, of ſoiling, and ſuch like; another can ſay, I am ſtill attending my cattell, I follow my ſheepe, I fodder them, I dreſſe them; another, I am conuerſant in building houſes, and my thoughts, and my hands, are taken vp in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and preparing timber, or ſtone for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Doubtleſſe it is as plaine, whether a man follow godlines, as whether he follow any of theſe vocations. A man may if hee will, know whether he be taken vp with thoughts and deſires of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, of auoiding ſinne, of ſubdoing his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, of planting and watring grace, of doing his dutie, which he hath learned out of Gods word, or whether hee bee a ſtranger to theſe things, and whether he do them conſtantly, or by ſtarts; &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be heedfull in all things, or ſpare himſelfe in ſome thing, and whether he ſtudy to pleaſe God in theſe things, or looke wholly or chiefly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: theſe things are not performed ſo ſecretly and vndiſcernably, but that hee which performeth them, may eaſily find and feele, that hee doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them. Wherefore be not ignorant of thy ſelfe, for want of in quiring into thy ſelfe; and for want of a due conſideration of thy life, doe not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20394:70"/>miſtake thy life, whether it be a fruitful life in Chriſt Ieſus, or elſe idle and vnprofitable. And if any man find not this generall endeauour to pleaſe God, it is not the giuing of now and then an almes or a piece of money to the poore; it is not the reading of now &amp; then a Chapter, or comming to heare a Sermon, or doing here and there ſome good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable worke, that can intitle him to the name of a fruitfull branch. And if any man doe find in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe this vniuerſall ſtable endeauor to glorifie and pleaſe God, in the knowing and doing of his whole will; it is not the failing and comming ſhort of his deſires, it is not the being ignorant, or miſtaking of many things, it is not the ſlipping into many ſinnes and faults (though ſometimes too too groſſe and palpable) that can diſpoſſeſſe him of this name, and make him to be accounted no fruitfull branch. It is very needfull, and withall, poſſible and eaſie for thee to know what thou art: therefore be entreated to conſider of it ſeriouſly and vnfainedly, and not to miſtake through heedleſneſſe or wilfulneſſe.</p>

Alacke what good ſhall we get by your diſcomfort or diſgrace! what benefit will your miſery bring vnto vs? Nay verily, wee haue no pleaſure (yea, we haue much griefe) in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing againſt men, that they be hypocrites. But wee muſt needes ſpeake the truth, that God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouthes, and that with all plaineneſſe, and with all earneſtnes, and with all authoritie: yea, ſo much the plainer, and more earneſt muſt we bee in this matter, by how much we do better vnderſtand, both the needfulnes of diſcouering to the hypocrit his hypocriſie, and withall the difficulty of making
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20394:71"/>him perceiue it, though it be diſcouered. For you know in how many places, the Scripture tells vs of ſuch, as in ſeeing, ſee not, which muſt needes bee verified in this matter, as well as in any other. An hypocrite is exceeding loath to count himſelfe an hypocrite: an harlot will ſcarce call her ſelfe a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; a theefe will ſcarce giue to himſelfe the name of theefe? how much leſſe will thoſe that ſinne in diſſembling, take to themſelues their owne names? Out of the naturall loue of our ſelues, which doth inordinately poſſeſſe vs; and out of ſome common notion that euery man hath, of the vileneſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes; it comes to paſſe, that moſt ſinners are vnwilling to intitle themſelues by their ſinnes. But of all others the diſſembler (the principall piece and buſineſſe of whoſe occupation it is, to hide that which is euill, out of ſight) will be moſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to thrattle his hypocriſie (as it were) by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand vpon the throate of it, and drawing himſelfe to a round confeſſion, in plaine termes ſaying, In very deed I am but an hypocrite. A man that hath been thought by himſelfe and others, to be worth many thouſands, is very vnwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelfe a bankerout, and it ſounds as terrible as death in his eares to ſay, I haue caſt vp my reckonings, &amp; find my ſelfe not worth a groat: euen ſo a man that hath long been taken for a good Chriſtan, is very backward to ſee and confeſſe, that all his Chriſtianitie was in formes, and that he is not the man hee was taken for but an errand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler. For why, the heart of man is loath either to perceiue himſelfe ſo wretched, as he cannot but

But brethren, vntill hypocriſie be plainely diſcerned, it can neuer be reformed; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, nor any other vice will cuer be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if it be not eſpied. He ſhall for euer remaine an hypocrite, that being ſo, will not confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo to be. For when a man is ignorant of his vnhappineſſe, he will neuer ſet himſelfe with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to redreſſe it; and certainely ſinne will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ouercome, without ſtriuing againſt it.

Aſſure your ſelues, you ſhall neuer attaine the benefits of Chriſts death and reſurrection, vnleſſe you ſhew forth the power of both in your liues: that is to ſay, vnleſſe the ſerious conſideration of the loue and goodneſſe of God, ſhewed in theſe two; and of the hatefulneſſe and filthineſſe of ſinne, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the former of them, doe leaue ſo deepe an impreſſion in your ſoules that here-hence you grow both reſolute and able (in ſome degree) to caſt away all the former luſts of your ignorance, and now to turne your feete into the pathes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to fight againſt all the corrupt luſts of your hearts, to labour to forbeare all wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to endeauor to plant in your ſoules all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and to be abundant in religious, mercifull, iuſt, temperate, and all other godly actions, that you may ſhew forth the vertues of him, that hath tranſlated you from darkeneſſe to light, and be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all good conuerſation, euen as hee is holy. Vrge and preſſe your ſelues therefore to this fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and make the conſtant carriage of your whole man, inward and outward euen depoſe for you, that yon are truly ingraffed into the true vine. This fruitfulneſſe ſhall ariſe for you in the day of tentation, as it did for <hi>Iob</hi> and inable you to ſtand for your vprightneſſe againſt all accuſations of men and diuels, and againſt all feares and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of your owne hearts. When a man is caſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20394:74"/>into the fornace ot aduerſitie, then will the leaues be blowne off (as in the winter they be from trees) &amp; then if the grapes of a good conuerſation doe not lye by him, to witneſſe that he was a true branch in Chriſts body, nothing will remaine for him but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and amazement, and a fearefull expectation of vengeance to befall him for all his ſhewes. Be you therefore prepared for the day of triall, which will ſurely come vpon all the inhabitants of the earth. Striue to be fruitful: ſtirre vp your ſelues to conſider ſeriouſly of the Lords infinite bounty in Chriſt: ſhew to your ſelues the ſweetnes and goodneſſe of the diuine Maieſty, in that worke ſo admirable &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueably gratious. Prouoke your ſelues to make high account of him, &amp; to loue him with the moſt vehement and feruent of all loue: that your hearts being knit-vnto him, and ſet vpon him, you may euen for his ſake ſet your ſelues to know the good, &amp; the euill, that pleaſeth and diſpleaſeth him, to ſhun the laſt, &amp; imbrace the firſt. Vrge your ſelues not to dally with-him, not to offer him a parcell of obedience, an halting goodneſſe, but inlarge your deſires and endeauors to the knowing and keeping of his whole will in all things. Let none obiection, none inclination of fleſh and bloud, make you to giue way to the ſinfulneſſe of your hearts in any thing, but ſtill continue and perſiſt to fight againſt the ſinnes, which you cannot wholly ſubdue, and to mortifie that by the ſpirit, whereof you cannot quite be rid. Prouoke and annimate your ſelues to the doing of theſe things: ſay within your ſelues, O that I could doe ſo; Iong for grace and ſtrength ſo
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20394:74"/>to doe, and call vpon thy ſelfe to be more and more carefull of bearing fruite in this Vine.</p>
                     <p>The Vine it ſelfe is a moſt ſappy and iuyeefull Vine, abundantly ſtored with that heauenly verdure and moyſture, that may ſerue to make the branches fruitfull. The husbandman is no way defectiue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in skill or paines; hee is neither ignorant, nor heedleſſe of any thing, that may further the branches in their fruitfulneſſe. There is no want either on Gods part, or on Chriſts part, but all on ours. No man is vnfruitfull, but for lacke of will and care to be ſo. I pray you be not wanting to your ſelues, but ſtriue to be fruitfull: for in this Vine, euery branch might be fruitfull, if he were not either wilfull, or ſlothfull, or both. But that mine exhortation may not be booteleſſe, I ſhall direct you how you may doe to be fruitfull, and declare thoſe things vnto you, by the doing of which you ſhall be ſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine power to liue holily: and theſe directions ſhall be both ſo few, that you may remember them; and ſo eaſie, that you ſhall not neede to complaine of difficultie in performance.</p>
                     <p>The meanes therefore to become fruitfull,<note place="margin">The meanes of becomming fruitfull.</note> are theſe: Firſt, a man muſt ſee &amp; lament his former vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſſe, freely confeſſing, that of himſelfe he is drie and barren, and vtterly vnable to bring forth fruite. Whoſoeuer would liue godlily,<note place="margin">1. To ſee and lament former vnfruitfulneſſe</note> muſt with ſorrow obſerue and confeſſe, that his life hath beene farre ſhort of that godlineſſe, which hee ſhould and might haue obtained, and that in him as of himſelfe, there remaineth no power to make himſelfe godly, and to make his conuerſation holy
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20394:75"/>for the time to come. Yea, this muſt be a meanes of making him heauy in heart, and baſe and vile in his owne eyes, as that he hath been fruitleſſe; ſo that he ſhall remain fruitleſſe ſtil, vnleſſe he haue a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall worke of Gods Spirit, to make him fruitfull. And for want of this ſence &amp; acknowledgement of their owne wants, it comes to paſſe, that moſt men ſtill remaine, and ſtill will remaine vnfruitful. They thinke théy do already liue a godly life; they thinke they can turne themſelues when they luſt to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life; they are ouer highly conceited of their own ſufficiency, &amp; they dreame they haue gone further than they haue. But would you not be fruitleſſe &amp; barren for heereafter? ſee then (with ſorrow) that you haue been ſo (at leaſt in ſome meaſure) hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and know, that it muſt not be a power dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in your ſelues, which muſt make you better, but a borrowed power, deriued from aboue.</p>
                     <p>And when you haue bin drawne to this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, then giue your ſelues with all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<note place="margin">2. Attend to the word read and preached.</note> to attend vnto the Word of God, both read and preached; be attentiue (I ſay) to the Scriptures, both in reading and hearing them: for this is that good ſeed, which if it be not receiued, no fruit can grow; if it be, there is a poſſibility of being fruitful. Remember that the Lord hath appointed, to deriue the graces of his Spirit into your hearts, by meanes of his Word; and that he hath appoynted men (as inſtruments and fellow-labourers) to make you, of euill, good, and of good, better; and therefore you muſt ſubmir your ſelues vnto the will of God, and giue your mindes to an heedefull attendance vpon
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20394:75"/>his ordinance. But remember, that we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your bare bodily preſence at the Church, and in the ordinances of God: a man may be preſent in body, and abſent in minde; &amp; this his preſence ſhall but prouoke God againſt him, becauſe it is but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect mocking of God. Yea, you muſt bring your ſoules to the Church, as well as your bodies; and marke, &amp; hearken, and obſerue, and conſider what is ſpoken to you in Gods name. A man muſt come to the Word of God, as to the Word of God; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be Gods power to his ſaluation, and a meanes that God hath appointed by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, reproofes, exhortations, comforts thereof, to plant and water all graces in him, to beate downe his ſinnes, to build vp his new man, and to tranſlate him into the image of Ieſus Chriſt. Moſt people that come to the Word, for want of eſteeming it as an inſtitution of God for ſo happy a purpoſe, haue no care at all of themſelues in hearing, neuer looke to their thoughts, neuer incline their eares, neuer liſten, neuer heede what is ſpoken. They ſit there (it may be) quietly and ſtilly for their poſition of body, but are ſhaken vp and downe in their ſoules, with a world of idle or euill imaginations, which ſtop out all that, that ſhould bee conueighed into their minds to doe them good: ſo they giue Satan leaue to fill vp their minds with vanitie, that there may be no roome for the grace of God. To ſuch hearers we can promiſe no bleſſing: but it is the attentiue marking and obſeruing the Word (out of a good opinion of it, and an honourable eſteeme, as a ſauing inſtrument appointed of God to make men
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20394:76"/>holy) which we preſcribe vnto you as a meanes of changing your barrenneſſe into fruitfulneſſe; by the lips of his faithfull ſeruants, will Ieſus Chriſt drop vertue into the hearts of thoſe, that come to ſeeke it there. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Meditate vpon it after. wards.</note> after hearing and reading, you muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate and conſider of that which you haue heard, you muſt apply it to your ſelues, you muſt trie your ſelues by it, you muſt duly conſider, whether you performe the things which it declareth vnto you, yea or no; and if you haue beene failing, prouoke your ſelues to more carefulneſſe; you muſt vrge your ſelues to giue credit vnto the promiſes and threats, and to ſay within your ſelues, this good or euill, ſhall ſurely be performed vnto me according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And ſo mighty is the Word of God, that if it be thus hidden in the heart, it ſhall ſurely purge the heart, &amp; make it good; if it be ingraffed in the ſoule, it is able to ſaue the ſoule; if it bee couered with earth, it wil bring forth a crop; neither is any branch ſo barren and vnfruitfull, but by thus applying the Word to it ſelfe in priuate meditation, it ſhall by little and little be made fruitfull. But many men doe want the power of the Word, becauſe they content themſelues barely to reade or heare the Word; or if they marke it a little for the preſent, they eſteeme-that ſufficient, neuer taking care to goe alone, and lay it faſt vnto their owne hearts. Take knowledge (I pray you brethren) of the true cauſe, why the Word of God doth not profit the moſt of your ſoules: you come hither to heare it, perhaps alſo you gine ſome reaſonable heede to it, and can
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20394:76"/>remember what was ſpoken, and can talke of it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if occaſion ſerue: but the world with its buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or delights, doth ſo bewiteh and beguile you, that you can find neither heart nor time, neither wil nor leaſure to call againe to mind, the things that you haue heard; and to aske your ſelues, Doe I this dutie? am I guilty of this ſinne? doth not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe pertaine to me? haue I any part in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? and accordingly to ſtriue with your owne hearts to be either humbled or comforted, and ſo to reſolue on amendment and reformation according to the Word. This is the cauſe that we haue ſo too too many fruitleſſe hearers. Hence it is, that ſo much is taught, ſo little practiſed. How long will you continue to neglect this moſt ſauing and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable exerciſe, of binding the Word on the tables of your hearts, and of incorporating it into your ſoules, and being Gods inſtruments, to ingraue it in your owne minds, by meditating on it, and by bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying your cogitations vpon it afterwards, as a thing that much concerneth you? How often haue you been told, that much hearing without meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wil breede nothing but a ſwimming knowledge? that it will not beget holineſſe? that it will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the ſoule? but that hearing ſeconded with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, will quicken and will ſanctifie? I pray you take notice of this fault, &amp; amend it. Redeeme time, as to come and hearken to the voyce of God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee; ſo likewiſe to get alone afterwards, and apply it to thy ſelfe in thy ſerious meditations. Certainely if we did thus declare our high eſteeme of Gods Word, and make it appeare, that our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20394:77"/>ſoules did account of it, as of a thing moſt pretious and healthfull to our ſoules, the Lord of heauen would not faile to giue his bleſſing, and to make it mighty, to the working of a godly conuerſation in vs, &amp; it ſhould bring forth the fruit of good liuing.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly,<note place="margin">Laſtly, pray to God to make vs, frui. full by his Spirit.</note> you muſt alſo ioyne with your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating (which he that meditateth cannot but doe; he that meditates not, can hardly doe in any ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe) conſtant prayer vnto God for his holy Spirit, to write his Law in your inward parts, to engraue it in the fleſhly tables of your hearts, and to moue and incline your wills to obedience, that ſo you may become the Epiſtle of God, miniſtred by men. For fruitfulneſſe is a ſupernaturall effect: it comes not from any power inherent in mans ſoule, or ariſing from his owne wil: but it is an effect of the ſpirit of life and grace, which is ſent from Chriſt the Vine, as it were ſap, into the ſeuerall branches, that doe ſucke and draw it from him in his ordinances, and by name, by faithfull, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and continuall requeſting it at his hands. You muſt therefore make conſcience to call vpon God, for the good worke of his ſpirit, to helpe you to liue holily, to make you aſſured of his loue, feruent in loue to him, zealous of his glory, and conſtant in walking in his lawes. And in particular, you muſt daily beg of him to ſtrengthen you, for the performance of ſuch and ſuch duties, and leauing of ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, as from time to time the Word of God which you heare, doth call vpou you to leaue or to performe. God will be entreated for all good things, and hee hath bound himſelfe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20394:77"/>not to deny the requeſts of all that call on him.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.8.</note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that ſeeketh, findeth: O comfortable and large promiſe! anſwering all obiections, and able to ſtay vp the ſoule againſt all diſcouragements. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man was ſo wicked &amp; ſinful, but if he would come to the Lord, &amp; earneſtly beſeech him for his name ſake, to change his heart and life, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue conſtant in following this ſuite, the Lord did ſurely hearken vnto him, and make him godly. You cannot be good of your ſelues, but you may (if you will not winke) ſee your owne badneſſe, and your owne impotency. You may (if you will not harden your owne hearts, and make your ſelues careleſſe of your owne ſoules) cry and call to God to make you good, and importune him with perpetuall ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to bow and incline your hearts to keep his precepts, to open your eyes to ſee, and your hearts to entertayne his holy Law; that you may conuert, and he may heale you. This I ſay you may doe, if you do not make your ſelues wilfull and obſtinate, by contemning the exhortations of Gods Word, and euen ſtopping your eares againſt it, and by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full turning your hearts after other matters. I haue ſhewed you now, how the barren may become fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, how the dry may be filled with ſap, and how the liues of them may be made godly and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which are yet farre from godlineſſe and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. See your barrenneſſe; and to attentiue hearing, ioyne diligent meditating on the Word you heare; and conſtant prayer vnto GOD for the ſtrength of his Spirit, to make his Word effectuall, and to giue you grace to obey it; then ſhall you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20394:78"/>ſurely be made branches bringing forth fruit; for then do you abide in Chriſt, and his word abideth in you, and that our Sauiour himſelfe doth after wards preſcribe as an infallible way to bring forth much fruit.</p>

For all thoſe therfore that do bring forth fruit in Chriſt, in ſuch ſort as hath bin ſhewd, we haue much good to ſpeake, and ioyfull tidings to deliuer. Wee are to aſſure and ſecure them, againſt all the feares of their owne hearts, againſt all the cauils of Satan, and falſe cenſures of the wicked world, that they be not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but true-hearted, and ſincere Chriſtians. Whoſoeuer amongſt you findeth, that in his ſoule, the conſideration of Gods infinit goodnes through his onely Son, hath had ſuch a powerfull working, that it hath euen knit his heart ſaſt vnto the author of ſo great kindneſſe; and made him euen ſay and ſweare within himſelf, that he would ſurely keep his righteous iudgements; &amp; made him conſtant in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all pains to mortifie his corruptions, &amp; to doe his duty in euery thing, according to the diuine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: ſo that there is no one thing ſo comfortable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20394:78"/>to him, as when he can carry himſelfe in ſome good maner, as beſeems the Goſpel of Chriſt; &amp; nothing doth more humble &amp; abaſe him, than when he fails of this holy walking; &amp; if it were demaunded of his very ſoule, what in all the world he moſt hartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and would faineſt attaine in all his life? his hart would make this anſwer for him, that it is to pleaſe God, to get acquaintance with his duty, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it accordingly: this he wiſheth, this hee longeth for, this he coueteth more, than all wealth or greatneſſe, or other gailded toy, that the world hath to giue him. I ſay now in Gods name to euery ſuch perſon (and require him in Gods name to giue credit vnto my words, becauſe they are infallibly grounded on Gods Word) that he ought to be of good comfort, that he is a true Chriſtian, and no diſſembler, &amp; that for ſuch an one he ought to take himfelfe, notwithſtanding all the blemiſhes, errors, ignorances, imperfections; and it may be alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times groſſe out-ſtrayings of his life. Brethren, the true-hearted had neede to bee made to vnderſtand their trueth, as well as the falſe-hearted their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. For as the latter out of his ſelfe-liking diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ready to flatter himſelfe with ſweet words; ſo the former, out of his acquaintance with his own guileſulnes, and the ſight of his owne badneſſe and vnworthineſſe, is ready to threaten himſelfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſharpely, and to charge himſelfe eagerly (though wrongfully) that he is but an hypocrite. But now ye ſeruants of God, conſider that it is a fault to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt your ſelues with cauſeleſſe accuſations of your ſelues, or to be ignorant of the vnſpeakeable fauour
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20394:79"/>that God hath ſhewed you, or to deny the bleſſed work of his good Spirit in you. Yea you are bound in conſcience to acknowledge your own true-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes, and with hearty thanks vnto God, &amp; much chearefulnes in your ſelues, to approue your ſelues to him, and to your owne conſciences. I confeſſe, that it is far more dangerous to hope then to feare without a cauſe: but yet the inconueniences of theſe falſe ſeares, are alſo very many &amp; very great. When a man that is vpright. doth not account himſelfe ſo to be, he is vnable to thinke comfortably of dying, and leauing this World; he is backward to prayer; he can hardly giue thanks for any thing; he cannot long for the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; he cannot ſo much delight himſelfe in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heauen; he cannot be ſo patient in affliction: he cannot be ſo abundant in godly ſpeeches, to the edification of others, as elſe hee might be. Theſe feares therefore (though by God they be made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the beating downe of pride, and for the ferretting out of the reliques of guile that remaine in vs) are yet (vnleſſe they be ſeaſonably oppoſed &amp; remoued) very noyſome and hurtful, &amp; (like an Eaſt wind, cold and dry) do bite &amp; nip the branches, and cauſe the grapes to grow, but few, and little, vpon them. Wherfore you muſt be giuen to vnderſtand, that fruitfulneſſe may well ſtand with the hauing many weakeneſſes, ſins and corruptions; though not with the allowing, excuſing, maintaining, exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, denying, and wilfull winking at any. Thou haſt manifold corruptions in thee, much pride, vaine-glory, worldlineſſe, luſt, paſſion, reuengeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20394:79"/>&amp; twenty other like. But tel me; Doſt thou ſee and feele theſe corruptions? Doſt thou conſtantly obſerue the motions &amp; riſings of them with griefe, diſlike, deteſtation, &amp; iudging of thy ſelfe for them? Doſt thou make oppoſition to them, by preſſing on thine heart the promiſes, threates and precepts of the Word? by conſideration of the death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, by groanes in thy ſelfe, and by ſupplications vnto God; and ſo keepeſt them from vſuall breaking forth in extremitie and groſſeneſſe? or if they do at any time breake forth, doſt thou ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigue thy ſelfe for them in Gods preſence? not ceaſſing to wound and pierce thine owne heart, till thou findeſt it wrought to a renewed loathing of them? not ceaſſing to confeſſe them to the Lord, and cry for his helpe, till thou haſt renewed in thy ſelfe a firme purpoſe of no more returning vnto them? Doſt thou theſe things, I ſay, in all thy faults, weakneſſes and wandrings? then I affirme, that thou mayeſt be, and art fruitfull, notwithſtanding all theſe faults; and I tell thee, for the comforting of thine heart, that theſe things cannot bereaue thee of the title and priuiledgeof a fruitfull branch, and an vpright perſon. Againe, thou art very defectiue in vertues of all kindes, in faith, in meekeneſſe, in patience, in thankefulneſſe, in heauenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the reſt: But doſt thou take notice of theſe thy defects? Art thou grieued and aſhamed of them? Doſt thou call vpon God to make a ſupply? and call on thy ſelfe to labour for an encreaſe of them? Doſt thou ſtirre vp thy ſelfe to grow in theſe graces? &amp; not excuſe, pleaſe, and content thy ſelfe in

For to fruitfulnes is not required an actuall knowing and doing of all Gods will, but a labouring and ſtriuing to know and do the ſame, and that conſtantly, out of loue vnto him, &amp; for his glory. Wherefore if the loue of the Lord do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thy ſoule, that thou reſiſteſt earneſtly to all thy corruptions; and if the intention and purpoſe of pleaſing and honouring him, doe ſo conſtantly ſtand before thine eies, as to make thee take conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall paines, to reforme and amend thy ſelfe; I dare pronounce thee a fruitfull branch, &amp; a ſound-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtian: and I doe now require and enioyne thee, to fall downe before the Lord with heartie praiſes, for this ſo vnſpeakeable goodnes of his, in ingraffing thee into the right Oliue, and making thee a liuing member of his Sonne the Head and Prince, in whom all fulneſſe dwelleth. Yea, I wiſh thee to reioyce, &amp; to delight thy ſelfe in abundance of peace, through the certaine acknowledgement of thine happy eſtate that thou art not alone in, but alſo of the Church, and truely partaker of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and verdure of the right Oliue tree. To know a mans ſelfe fruitfull in ſome degree, will make him fruitfull in an higher. The man that ſuſpecteth himſelfe to be worſe than nothin, goes fearefully &amp; faintly about his buſineſſe: but he that is certaine hee hath ſomething of his owne (though not ſo much as he would) is chearefull and forward in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20394:82"/>his calling. It doth likewiſe euen dampe the courage of a good Chriſtian, in following the trade of godlineſſe, when hee is ſtill cauſeleſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelfe to haue no truth, no ſinceritie, no vprightneſſe: but to know that hee hath truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (and yet is farre ſhort of perfection), this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth him to goe forward in ſtriuing after perfection. The conſolation that pietie affordeth, is a principall furtherer of our good proceedings in it; and therefore thou muſt take comfort in the truth of thy beginnings, that thou mayeſt goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a liuelier pace, and greater diligence. Conſider heere, how that our Sauiour doth not name the bringing forth of as much, and as faire fruit, as others, for the note of a good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing branch, but ſimply the bringing forth of fruit: and therefore if thou beeſt in any degree fruitfull, though neyther ſo much as thou wouldeſt, or ſhouldeſt, or ſeeſt others to bee; yet there is iuſt cauſe of receiuing comfort. Indeed the littleneſſe of our fruit ſhould humble vs, but not diſcourage vs. It ſhould ſtand before our eyes, to keepe vs from pride, not from peace; to ſtop vs from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe, not to hinder our comfort in God. Satan that deſireth to make all things harmefull vnto vs, labours alſo to turne the reliques of ſinne (which remaine in vs), to the ouer-much diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and terrifying of our conſciences, and to the ſhaking of our faith, and interrupting the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we might enioy in God: but let vs not yeeld to the ſubtiltie and malice of Satan in this behalfe. When thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe failing in the meaſure of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20394:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>fruit, obſerue this fayling well, but turne it not the worſt way. Let it make thee charge thy ſelfe with too much negligence, not with vtter hollowneſſe; conclude from it, that thou art but weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not that thou art but an hypocrite and dlſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler. And now let all Gods people, chiefly thoſe that are full of doubts and feares, depart away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and eſtabliſhed in comfort: let their ſpirits be at peace within them, and let them feede of the fat and ſweete portion, which the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. The ioy of the Lord will bee their ſtrength; theſe comforts will ripen their fruites, as the Sunne-beames doe the fruites of the earth, and they ſhall with moſt eaſt and aſſurance grow better and better, when they find the comfort and benefit, of being truly good already. So then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thou thus for thy ſelfe; euery fruitfull branch is a true Chriſtian, I am fruitfull (though not of ſo large, faire &amp; ripe cluſters as others, yet) of Grapes: my life is truly holy and good (though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching ſo neare to perfection as it ſhould); and therefore I will not doubt to eſteeme my ſelfe a true Chriſtian, and to giue the Lord the glory &amp; praiſe, and take to my ſelfe the comfort and peace of my ſinceritie. And ſo we haue ſpoken of the obiect of Gods Husbandrie; the parts of which we will hereafter entreat of at ſome conuenient time, if God afford vs life and opportunity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
                     </hi> Make bold (good Reader) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto thy view, this ſecond part of <hi>Gods Husbandry,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a few Sermons, which I preached vpon the words of Chriſt, in the fifteenth of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell. My maine inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein was, to helpe the people of God, againſt that miſerable ſinne of Hypocriſie, which in the former Treatiſe I ſought to diſcouer. Doubtleſſe all our paines, and all our preaching, is little enough, and too little, to make men ſee, and reforme ſo perillous, and withall ſo ſubtill a vice. This is a diſeaſe of ſo darke a working, as will hardly be diſcerned, vntill it be paſt cure. And though a man bee not ſo totally poſſeſſed and ouercome by it, as that he deſerue to bee called an Hypocrite, yet are the remainders of it (which abide in the moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified hearts, as the Canaanites amongst the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi>) exceeding troubleſome, and exceeding noyſome, calling for all diligence and labour to expell them. It is the daughter of ignorance and ſelfe-loue, the mother of pride and ſelfe-conceitedneſſe, the ſiſter of vaine-glory and contention. It is, of all ſinnes, one of
<pb facs="tcp:20394:85"/>the moſt hideous, becauſe it damneth thoſe, that ſeeme to themſelues little leſſe then free from all other ſinnes. When the whole army of vices is fled before the face of vertue, and ſeemes to haue yeelded a full victory, then doth this vice (as it were by ſtratagems and deuices) vndermine victorious vertue, and rob it of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which it ſeemed to haue gotten. It is the refuge and hiding place of all other faults: neither can wee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preuaile againſt any corruption, then we preuaile againſt this: neither can any corruption further foyle vs, then this doth lend it aide and ſuccour. This vice maketh thoſe things abominable in Gods ſight, which to menward ſeeme praiſeable, and cauſeth that heauen doth deteſt, what earth applauds. It comes to Church with men, and poyſons preaching, praying, hearing, reading, receiuing the Communion, and all the parts of Gods ſeruice. It is bold to creepe into the clozet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with ſome men, and doth many times corrupt their moſt retired deuotions. It maketh that the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelfe but mocked, when men account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue well worſhipped him. It turnes mercy, iuſtice, chaſtity, into vices after a ſort, and cauſeth that they be in true iudgement, but faire and guilded ſins. It marreth in one word, all good things, and changeth the not committing of ſinne, into a ſinne, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the moſt commendable duties, into very loathſome euill. A deuout Hypocrite, is little better then a profane Epicure, and a painted Sepulohre, is little different from a very dunghill. Happy ſhall that man be, that is carefull to ſpy out the working of this crooked and deceitfull vice in himſelfe, and that with earneſtneſſe, diligence, warineſſe, and conſtancy, doth
<pb facs="tcp:20394:85"/>ſtriue to chaſe it out of his owne heart. When the Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites, (wretched claw-backes as they were) came to waken <hi>Sauls</hi> ſleeping malice, by offering him their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to deliuer vp <hi>Dauid:</hi> the Story tels vs, that he ſent them backe with this inſtruction, <hi>Goe and prepare yet, and know, and ſee his place, and where his haunt is, and who hath ſeene him there; for it is told me, that he dealeth very ſubtilly. See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and take knowledge of all his lurking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where hee hideth himſelfe, and come yee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to me with the certainty, and I will goe with you; and it ſhall come to paſſe, if hee be in the Land, I will ſearch him throughout all the thouſands of Iudah.</hi> This was maliciouſly ſpoken by an enuious Prince, againſt his faithfull ſubiect and ſonne. But well were it with vs, if wee could all make vſe of his words, in the purſuit of our hidden guile, and follow it as cloſe as euer <hi>Saul</hi> did follow <hi>Dauid,</hi> euen to ſeeke and ſearch, and ſpy out all its lurking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and neuer ceaſe ſeeking, till we haue found it, nor fighting, till we haue vanquiſhed it, as one of the most dangerous of all our ſpirituall enemies, the very ſoule of the body of death, and that, that giueth life to all the reſt. I beſeech the liuing God for thee, Reader, that he will pleaſe to ſanctifie, as other meanes, ſo theſe my weake indeuours, (if thou pleaſe to make vſe of them) to helpe thee againſt this peſtilent fault. And I craue thy prayers for mee alſo, that my ſelfe may be able to practiſe what I haue taught thee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing befall me not, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, vpon another occaſion, <hi>that hauing preached to others, I my ſelfe ſhould be a reprobate.</hi> For this hatefull
<pb facs="tcp:20394:86"/>and banefull vice, the worst of vices, doth ſometimes ſtep into the Pulpit alſo, and cauſeth euen Miniſters to condemne themſelues in iudging others, becauſe they that iudge, doe the ſame things; and becauſe they lay heauy burthens vpon other mens ſhoulders, and themſelues reſuſe to touch them, that is to ſay, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earneſt exactors of good duties, and very ſlow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the ſubiect of Gods Husbandry, wee haue already ſpoken, namely, of the branches of the Vine, in which wee haue conſidered, a diſtribution of them into their ſeuerall kinds, and a diſtinction of them by their ſpeciall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of fruitleſſe and fruitfull. Let vs now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20394:88"/>to declare the parts of Gods Husbandry, which are diuers, according to the diuerſe nature of the branches. For the vnfruitfull branch, the hypocrite, he carries himſelfe towards it, as beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a good husband; he cuts it off, that is to ſay, he doth by little and little ſeparate him from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and from the benefits of Chriſt, with whom hee ſeemed once to bee vnited: Cauſing that he loſeth the good things he ſeemed to haue, and ſo by falling off from thoſe appearances of goodneſſe which were in him, hee diſcouereth himſelfe to haue but counterfeited, till, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to greater ſinfulneſſe, at laſt eternall death doe ouerwhelme him. But for the fruitfull branch, the vpright-hearted Chriſtian, the Lords dealing with him is farre otherwiſe: hee is alone purged or pruned. The hypocrite is himſelfe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the Vine, the true Chriſtian hath onely ſomething taken off from him, that he may very well ſpare, being pared about to the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall of that, that by continuing vpon him, would haue done him much hurt. You all know what the naturall pruning is, <hi>viz.</hi> the cutting off from the branches, ſuch vnprofitable and ouergrowing twiſts, leaues, or the like, as doe no way bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the branch, but hurt it rather, in cauſing the fruit thereof to be leſſer and ſcanter then it might be. The thing ſignified heereby, is the ſubduing of the corruptions of Gods ſeruants, <hi>viz.</hi> their pride, paſſion, ſelfe-loue, earthly-mindedneſſe, voluptuouſneſſe, and the like diſorders, which if they were not mortified, they would runne all out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20394:88"/>into a faire ſhew of profeſſion, not at all fructify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an holy conuerſation: but when theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are taken away by diuers needefull meanes, as the Lord himſelfe knowes the fitteſt meanes (for he is but an ill Vine-dreſſer, that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his pruning inſtruments, then is that end ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which God intendeth) and then follows that effect wherein themſelues reioyce, <hi>viz. they bring foorth more fruit.</hi> They become more rich in the worke of the Lord, more plentifull in all godlineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and in all excellent ſeruices to God and man. They doe more good, they liue more profitably and ſeruiceably, and are euery way more abundant in all the fruits of the Spirit, ioy, peace, loue, righteouſneſſe, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, meekeneſſe, goodneſſe, and the reſt, then euer elſe they would haue beene. And thus you may ſee, that in theſe words we are led to ſpeake of foure moſt neceſſary points. The deſtruction of hypocrites The corruptions of Gods true Saints, in that they need pruning. The helpe they haue againſt theſe corruptios by pruning. And the good they get by this pruning, <hi>viz.</hi> growth in godlineſſe: of which, whilſt I doe ſpeake with as much plaineneſſe and euidence as I can, let me craue you alſo to attend with all diligence and reuerence.</p>

                        <hi>and the fall thereof was great,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour, in the concluſion of his Sermon on the mount. The ſtony ground alſo withered away in the heate, and the thorny was ouerrunne with thornes. The earth that drinketh in the raine which commeth vpon it, and bringeth forth no better fruit then thornes and bryers, is neere vnto curſing, whoſe end ſhall be burning, ſaith
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20394:89"/>the Author to the Hebrewes: And from him that hath not, (meaning in truth) that ſhall bee taken away which he ſeemed to haue, as our Sauiour tells vs. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth giue vs examples of this ruine of diſſemblers, ſaying of many in his time, <hi>They went out from vs, becauſe they were not of vs.</hi> Thus hath the Lord beene abundant in diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his intended vengeance againſt the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>That you may the better conceiue of Gods Wiſedome and Iuſtice herein; we will ſhew you in what degrees, and by what inſtruments, the Lord doth cut off theſe dry branches. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are likely theſe, and thus they follow one vpon another. Firſt, whereas they had ſome workes of common grace beſtowed vpon them, as the inlightening of their mindes, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to conceiue diuine truths, the framing of their wils to a liking of exerciſes of piety, a gladneſſe to heare and ſpeake of the Word, a gladneſſe of the company of good men, and the like; theſe workes are (by Gods iuſt Iudgement, becauſe they refuſe to make a good vſe of them, in turning all to the thorow changing of their hearts, and reforming of their liues) euen quite withdrawne from them; and ſo there followes a ſenſible withering: they care not for the Word, they care not for the company of the Saints, that once contented them, and Religion ſeemeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo goodly a thing vnto them, as ſomtimes it did. Secondly, whereas they had once the ſpirit of reſtraint beſtowed vpon them, to hold downe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20394:90"/>their corruptions, and to keepe the badneſſe of their hearts from ſhewing it ſelfe in extremity: the Lord doth now pleaſe to remooue theſe bars, ſo to auenge himſelfe vpon their ingratitude and ſtubbornneſſe, that did winke with their eyes, and reſiſt the offers of loue made to them, and refuſe to open the doore when hee ſtood there and knocked, and to giue them ouer into the hands of their owne euill natures, that they may breake foorth openly, and diſcouer themſelues how rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they were at heart, by running into ſome ſuch vile practice as carries them quite away, ſo that they neuer returne againe by repentance, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhew themſelues to be ſoundly humbled for the ſame. Then doth he ſend the temptations of Satan, together with the affrightments or allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, whereby they are ſo cleane pule away from the ſhew of godlineſſe, that at laſt, they grow profeſſedly cold and careleſſe in open ſhew, bearing before them an allowance of themſelues, in ſuch their luke-warmeneſſe; yea, perhaps alſo they turne very enemies of that goodneſſe which they ſeemed to haue; fall out with thoſe perſons that they ſeemed beſt to loue; brooke leaſt that company that ſeemed moſt to ſatisfie them, and become bitter, harſh, ſharpe, violent, in ſpeaking euill of thoſe perſons and things that were once approoued by them; and laſtly, ſome miſerable and fearefull end (wherein they are either ſwallowed vp of horrible deſpaire, or ſold ouer to the moſt ſtony hardneſſe that may be) doth rent them from the land of the liuing,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20394:90"/>and ſend them downe to hell. And ſo is fulfilled that of our Sauiour in the ſixth verſe, The bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that abide not in him, are caſt foorth and wither, and gathered, and caſt into the fire and burnt. Now the meanes of cutting them off, are many, euen all things that doe befall them: for all workes together to the ruine of them that ſell themſelues ouer into the hands of ſinne, as well as for the good of them that worke righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but chiefly the Word of God it ſelfe (a two-edged ſword) becauſe they will not yeeld vnto it, that it might cut off their corruptions from their ſoules, becomes a ſauour of death, a weapon of vengeance, to cut off their ſoules from God: for by their often reſiſting it, and much ſetting of their wits and conſciences vpon the tenters, to ſhift and dally with it, they become blinder and blinder, and harder and harder, till at length they bee ſold ouer vnto vtter blindneſſe, and giuen cleane into the power of ſinne and Satan, from which they ſeemed once to be redeemed. And thus was <hi>Iudas</hi> cut off, as the Scriptures ſhew vs. Hee was firſt a thiefe, allowing himſelfe in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe and purloyning, and not heeding the checkes of his owne heart, which, euery man muſt needs know, would be apt to be moouing within him, being a perſon of ſo great knowledge as he was, and after he prooued a very deuill, when he dipt his hands into the warme and innocent blood of his heauenly Maſter, and well-knowne Sauiour. The Lord, to puniſh his guile, in not oppoſing his couetouſneſſe and falſhood, put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20394:91"/>him cleane vp into the hands of the deuill, and his owne both rage and lucre, till Satan had poſſeſſed him, with a full purpoſe of turning on the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſide, (where he ſaw more likelihood of riſing) and of making himſelfe a faire way into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, by ſelling his Maſter vnto them for a little money. And thoſe reproofes and warnings of our Sauiour Chriſt, which ſhould haue withdrawne him from this reuolt and treaſon, did nothing elſe through his deſperate wilfulneſſe, but inrage, imbitter, and inuenome him; prouoking him more and more againſt his Maſter, till he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the very ſhew of his former appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring goodneſſe, and changed from being Chriſts Apoſtle, to be his apprehender: and a little after he was vtterly cut off, and gathered and throwne into the fire and burnt, when deſpaire was ſent againſt him in ſuch fierceneſſe, that it droue him to hang himſelfe, that is to ſay, to leape quicke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, his owne place, as <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it. So alſo was <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the type of <hi>Iudas,</hi> cut off, and ſo <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and many more: and ſo alſo are all hypocrites ſooner or later cut off, being caryed away, either with hereſies, or ſchiſmes, or perſecutions, or worldlineſſe, or voluptuouſneſſe, and at laſt with deſpaire or hardneſſe, with ſome heauy hand of God likely, and damnation for the vp-ſhot.</p>

                           <hi>1.</hi> Sees.</note> Though the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doe couer himſelfe ouer with ſuch a thicke cloudy as the eyes of men are not able for the moſt part to pearce thorow it, and diſcerne him: yet the Lord of heauen doth alwaies ſee him, and ſee thorow him. His eyes in euery place behold the euill and the good: He tryeth the hearts, he ſearcheth the reynes, he ſpyeth into the deepeſt and darkeſt corners of euery ſoule. Hell and deſtruction are before the eyes of the Lord: how then ſhould the hearts of the ſonnes of men be hidden from him? Nay doubtleſſe, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darkeneſſe nor the ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themſelues, but his eyes doe obſerue, and his eye-lids doe pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their paths. From men like himſelfe, a man may make an eaſy ſhift to keepe his heart ſecret, yea, ſo is this vice giuen to cloaking and ſculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20394:92"/>that from a mans owne ſelfe, he will make a ſhift to hide the odiouſneſſe of his inſide, and this filthy guilefulneſſe of his owne ſpirit; But after all the turning, and ſhifting, and winding of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that ſhall proue true at length (in ſpight of all) which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is not mocked. There is no beguiling of that all-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye of our Maker. There is no poſſibility of offering couzenage, and putting tricks vpon the King of heauen. The Lord of all the world is not ſubiect to the weakeneſſe of earthly Princes, that often take flatterers for friends, and fawning ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, for loyal ſubiects: but euen ſuch as a man is in deede and truth, ſuch doth God eſteeme and take him for: for he doth not iudge after the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but iudgeth righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A man may ſay of hypocriſy, as once <hi>Iob</hi> in another ſence ſaid of Wiſdome: That it is hid from the eyes of all liuing, and kept cloſe from the Fowles of the aire: but God vnderſtandeth the way thereof, and hee knoweth the place thereof: for hee looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth vnder the whole heauen. Did not our Sauiour Chriſt know what was in man? and therefore alſo refuſe to truſt himſelfe, with thoſe hollow-harted beleeuers of his time? Did not he giue <hi>Iudas</hi> his right name, when hee carried himſelf moſt fairly and commendably to the world-wards? euen then, intitling him as he was worthy to be intitled, a diuell, when as yet, he remained diſguized with the vizard of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Doubtleſſe, as no wiſedome, counſell, nor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20394:92"/>vnderſtanding can preuaile againſt the Lord, to diſappoint him, (as <hi>Salomons</hi> Prouerb affirmeth;) So neither can any fraud, guile, or diſſembling, preuaile to beguile him. And is it poſſible that his pure eyes ſhould diſcouer him, and his iuſt and almighty hand not bee ſtretched out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him? Nay verily: for as he ſees him,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Hates.</note> ſo hee lothes him alſo, and lothes him in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, euen as we doe lothe a rotten ſepulchre for all its payntings: and as we would abhorre a cup full of filthy geere within, though the outſide were neuer ſo cleanly waſhed, and farely ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and as we could not but doe him, that ſhould beare great outward ſemblance of friendſhip and goodwill vnto vs, when his heart did harbor nothing but neglect of vs, or malice againſt vs. A falſe friend is alwaies more deteſtable vnto a man, when once his falſehood is made knowne, then the moſt violent, but profeſſed enemy. Doe you not thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> was as much or more imbittered againſt <hi>Achitophel,</hi> then againſt the Philiſtim or Moabite, that euer he fought with? The hypocrite, by ſeeming good, declares that he knowes what is good, and how it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced: And by but ſeeming alone, hee proueth that he hath no loue to that which hee confeſſeth to deſerue loue; and ſo ſinning againſt the light that is inkindled in him, muſt he not needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the holy eyes of the Diuine Maieſty againſt him? In truth, an hypocrite euen of the cloſer kinde, doth exceeding groſſely abuſe the Lord, and all his ordinances, and exceeding hainouſly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20394:93"/>peruert his patience and kindeneſſe, and turne the great myſtery of our ſaluation, into a very fable, ſeeing that he is not good in good earneſt, but in Ieſt, as one might well call it: and how then can it be otherwiſe, but that the wrath and indignation of God ſhould burne againſt him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto hell?<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Will glorify himſelfe by the hypocrite.</note> ſeeing that in the laſt place he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fully purpoſed to glorify himſelfe by all his creatures, findes none other way left, of reaping honour from the diſſembler, but alone by magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his Iuſtice in his ouerthrow. For he neglects the offers of his loue, and refuſeth to conuert, and wil not accept of ſaluation vpon thoſe conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, on which God would beſtow it vpon him. Wee know all, that God hath made all things for his owne glory, in the cleere demonſtration of his owne vnſpeakeable excellencies by them, and of this end he can no more fayle, or be diſappointed, then be defectiue in wiſdome &amp; goodnes; which, becauſe they be eſſentiall in him, he can no more come ſhort of perfection in them, then that hee can ceaſe to be himſelf. Now the hypocrite, by the continuing ſuch, doth make himſelfe vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeable of becomming an actiue inſtrument to glorify the Lord, by performing that that is good in his ſight: for fruitfull he will neuer be, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency ariſing alwaies from wilfulnes, or careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or both, ſeeing theſe twaine cannot at all or very hardly be ſeparated one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needes muſt he be made a paſſiue inſtrument of Gods honor, whether he will or no, ſeruing to declare his infinite iuſtice in his due deſtruction,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20394:93"/>by being forced to ſuffer the deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which his grieuous wickedneſſe doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge at the hands of his righteouſneſſe. If it be obiected, that God might conuert the hypocrite if he would: The anſwere is, By his omnipotent power he might, and ſo he migt the diuels too, and the very prince of the diuels, Beelzebub him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But wee muſt vnderſtand, that the Lord hath ſet downe a certaine way and order of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting men vnto him, agreeable to the rules of his owne vnſearchable wiſedome: euen ſuch a way, as is in it ſelfe moſt plaine, ſure and infallible, if the negligence and obſtinacy of men doe not hinder, and ſuch a way, as is moſt conuenient to procure the greateſt honour that may be vnto him, in their ſaluation, and that is, that man himſelfe ſhould become a working inſtrument with God, to his owne conuerſion and ſaluation. Which ſeeing the hypocrite will not doe, the Lord will neuer bee ſo ouer-gracious vnto him, as to bring him to heauen by another way, but will euen magnify himſelfe in deſtroying him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he neglected to take the right courſe that was ſhewed him, to doe himſelfe good. So you ſee reaſons enow on Gods part, why ſuch branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhould be ſeparated from the Vine. Conſider we of themſelues, and ſee if there be not more then cauſe of handling them with ſuch ſeuerity. Firſt, they thruſt away ſaluation from themſelues, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>2</label> as it is ſayd of the Iewes in another caſe,<note place="margin">From them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues whom. <hi>1.</hi> They thruſt away ſaluation from them</note> Becauſe they will not entertaine, and yeeld vnto the good motions of Gods Word and Spirit, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20394:94"/>doe vrge and preſſe them to turne vnto the Lord, and therefore, what can be expected in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that they ſhould procure vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues euen ſharpe and ſwift damnation? For is it not moſt equall, that he which will not receiue ſaluation, when it is proffered vnto him by God, ſhould vtterly periſh; as that he ſhould be ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and dye for hunger, which will not receiue foode, when it is put into his hands? Theſe men reſiſt and oppugne the Spirit of God, and will not accept of life vpon ſuch termes, as it may ſtand with Gods Iuſtice to beſtow it vpon them. If he would ſaue them, and giue them leaue to goe on in their beloued ſinnes too, O how glad they would be of ſuch a carnall way of comming to heauen! But if he wil not giue eternall life, but vnto thoſe that are carefull throughly to reforme their hearts and liues, they know not how to be at all that paynes. Surely the matter ſtanding thus betwixt the Lord and their ſoules, it could not ſtand with his righteouſneſſe, to preſerue them from ruine. The diſſembling Chriſtian dealeth by God, as the Diſciples of Chriſt did deale by him in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn.</hi> When he told them of eating his fleſh, and drinking his blood, they ſayd, This was an hard ſaying, who could heare it? and ſo went backe, and walked no more with him. So the hypocrite, hearing of remiſſion of ſinnes, of life, of ſaluation, thinkes they bee things very deſireable, and out of a will to haue a part in them, he will goe a great way with God: but when he heares of a generall renouncing of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20394:94"/>all ſinne, and of waſhing and clenſing his heart, and that without this care there is no ſaluation, he will not beleeue that the way to heauen is ſo narrow, he ſhrinkes backe at theſe exhortations, and thinkes, the Lord is an hard Maſter, and will goe with him no further. So then, ſeeing the fruitleſſe branch doth careleſly or obſtinately let paſſe the opportunity of ſauing himſelfe when it is often offered vnto him, what can be more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with God; then that hee ſhould bring vpon himſelfe eternall deſtruction? Againe, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite abuſeth the richeſt of all Gods benefits, his Word, his Sacraments, his Goſpell, the blood of his Son, his tender of mercy, and the reſt of thoſe ſupernaturall things that he hath to doe with. He turneth the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and like a very Swine, doth tread vnder foot the moſt precious pearle of Gods goodneſſe in Chriſt; and muſt not an heauy vengeance therefore needs oppreſſe him? Meate, drinke, apparell, wit, ſtrength, health, theſe be worthy gifts of God, and exceeding ſinfull is the abuſe of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in the ſight of God, as reaſon there is that it ſhould; and very heauy haue the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments been, that haue lighted vpon the abuſers of ſuch mercies. But theſe are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fauours, euery dayes benefits; the outcaſts of the world haue them, as wel as thoſe of Gods houſhold. Only the Word of God, his holy Ordinances, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of himſelfe, &amp; of his Son, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the offers of mercy to ſaue them from hell; theſe are peculiar fauours, highly-eſteemed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20394:95"/>kindneſſes, ſpecially beſtowed vpon thoſe of his owne family, with whom hee pleaſeth to bee in Couenant. Now the hypocrite abuſeth theſe, he peruerteth theſe, he flatters himſelfe in his ſins for all theſe, and when God himſelfe doth euen as it were, come a wooing vnto him, in all theſe ordinances, and beſeech him to be reconciled to receiue himſelfe for an husband, his Kingdome for a dowry, and Heauen for a ioynture, hee will none of the bargaine, vnleſſe he may haue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of inioying his ſinnes beſides. O how great an indignity is heere offered vnto God? how ſhamefull a repulſe doth the Lord receiue, and how vndeſerued a refuſall? wherefore, by how much the mercies of God, that the diſſembler abuſeth, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing obſtinate againſt them, are greater, by ſo much muſt God, in iuſtice, needes increaſe the ſharpnes and ſtrength of his blowes againſt his ſoule.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Doe much harme in the Church.</note> Againe, the hypocrite doth procure a number of miſchiefes in the vine where he growes, which muſt needs occaſion and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten his cutting off. Theſe diſcredit Religion, and cauſe it to bee ill ſpoken of; theſe being of Gods family in ſhew, doe bring an ill name vpon it, as once the ſpies did vpon the land of Canaan. They doe grieue the hearts of the vpright, and ſtrengthen the hands of other ſinners, and fill their mouthes with inſultation. Their barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and want of good fruit, doth adminiſter matter (vnto thoſe that are ready to cauill) of caſting reproches vpon the roote on which they grow, and vpon all the branches that grow by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20394:95"/>them. Neuer did any profeſſed enemy doe ſo much hurt to true Religion, and ſo much hinder the proceeding of true piety, as the hypocrite hath done. Hee is one of the chiefe ſtumbling blocks in the world; and if a woe be denounced againſt him by whom offences come, then the heauieſt of all woes muſt light vpon him, from whoſe default the greateſt of all ſcandals doe come. Doe you not conceiue what triumphing there was againſt Chriſt, when his owne Diſciple had ſold him for money? The dry branch is a great impediment to the fruitfulneſſe of the neighbour branches: and the vnfruitfull Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree doth euen keepe the ground idle. Hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth many from goodneſſe that might haue come vnto it, but for his ill example: hee diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth thoſe that would haue been more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſſe, but for his ill example. Hee makes thoſe that are willing to ſinne, bold alſo to be more outragious in ſinning, by his ill example. In a word, the Church of God did neuer receiue ſo great miſchiefes, as from the falſe members of it. It is then but need for the Lord to take a ſharpe and ſpeedy courſe againſt them. Laſtly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> Make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vncapable of honouring God any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</note> you may conclude all the other euill they doe, with putting your ſelues in mind of the euill that they doe vnto themſelues, by making themſelues vnfit to bring glory vnto God any other way, but in their puniſhment, as we ſaid before. They ſay of a Swine, that he neuer doth good till he come to the knife: ſo may we ſay of the Hypocrite, that he doth not bring any honour to God, till hee be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20394:96"/>faine to honour him perforce, in ſuffering the ſtrokes of his infinite Iuſtice. In his praying, in his receiuing the Sacraments, in his laborious following his calling, in his workes of mercy hee diſhonoureth God, in all the actions of his life he doth wholly diſhonour him, &amp; would for euer, if he might be ſuffred, continue to diſhonor him, doing all theſe things hollowly &amp; guilefully, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and ſeeking himſelf in them, and preferring himſelf the creature, before the Lord his Creator.

It will not ſerue the turne to be cloſe and retired, it cannot auaile to be of ſmooth and fine carriage; all colouring, all cloking is idle and bootleſſe. It is not poſſible to eſcape his eye and hand, but by caſting away our ſinnes in good earneſt, and a true and hearty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Let the Hypocrite offer thouſands of Rammes, and riuers of oyle; let him not ſpare the fruit of his body, euen his owne ſonnes and daughters, and put himſelfe to neuer ſo much coſt and charges; all is one, God will not be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by theſe gifts to tolerate his wickedneſſe.

                     <p>Men are oftentimes partiall to them of their owne family, and will not deale ſo rigorouſly with thoſe that vſe them kindly, though they ſin; but the Lord is vtterly voyd of all partiality, euen to thoſe that ſhrowd themſelues vnder his elbow, as it were, and ſeeme to bee as good ſeruants to him as may be, and giue him the ſweeteſt words
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20394:97"/>that they can inuent. Oh how pure and ſearching are the eyes of our God? how cleerly doth hee ſhew vnto vs, in the ouerthrow of Hypocrites, the truth of that, that the Pſalmiſt ſingeth? <hi>His eyes behold, his eye-lids try the ſonnes of men:</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Euill ſhall not dwell with him, the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight;</hi> and <hi>he hateth all the workers of iniquity.</hi> Looke we therefore vpon the ruine of <hi>Saul, Achitophel, Ioaſh, Amaziah, Iudas, Ananias, Saphira,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe tell vs of; conſider wee alſo of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of our owne time, wherein our eyes may haue ſeene the experience of the Lords ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt ſuch as haue trod in the euill ſteps of theſe forenamed, not learning to auoyd the waies of miſchiefe, wherein they haue ſeene others to be ouerwhelmed before them; and in all ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents let vs contemplate the righteouſneſſe, ſeuerity, wiſedome and prouidence of God, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his iuſt gouernment of his Church, that will not bee ſlacke (according to his threatning long ſince) to make deſolate the congregation of Hypocrites: and learne wee here-hence to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a louing and awfull admiration of ſo great iuſtice, mixed with ſo great wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>It is a great fault to rob God of the glory of his glorious workes, and not to take notice of his excellent attributes, diſcouered vnto vs in the rare effects thereof. The Lord deſireth to haue vs thinke and talke of theſe wonderfull workes of his, and to implant in our owne ſoules a cleerer knowledge, and a deeper reuerence of him, by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20394:98"/>meanes of them. For he knowes, that nothing is more beneficiall to our ſoules, then if we doe thus vſefully behold the lifting vp of his high hand: wherefore wee muſt not ſuffer our naturall dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to preuaile againſt vs, and to turne away our thoughts from obſeruing ſuch obſeruable things: which yet in this particular caſe, wee are moſt apt to doe. For I know not how it comes to paſſe in men, that whereas thoſe of them that are not extremely carnall and earthly-minded, can conſider the workes of his goodneſſe and mercy, with ſome admiration, wondring to finde ſo great kindneſſe ſhewed to creatures, that can ſo little either deſerue or requite the ſame: yet it is farre otherwiſe in the workes of his Iuſtice: here a kind of vniuſtifiable pity of the perſons miſery, ſtops our eyes from beholding the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods righteouſneſſe, and men are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing apt to praiſe him for the ſtrict proceeding of his iudgements againſt malefactors. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is a corruption in vs worthy to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>We ſeldome praiſe God, for ſhewing himſelfe iuſt againſt Hypocrites. Indeed if in the practice of their malice againſt the Church, and the true members of it, they fall downe wounded, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it falles out, here our intereſt maketh vs to be ſomewhat glad, and wee can finde in our hearts to thanke God, for that which procured our owne eaſe and ſafety: but if it fall otherwiſe, that the Lord execute his vengeance againſt thoſe whom himſelfe ſees worthy to be hated, wee not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20394:98"/>hauing any part in the quarrell, we doe not make ſuch executions a part of the matter of our thankeſgiuing, as if wee regarded Gods workes nothing at all, further then ſome benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds therefrom vnto our ſelues, or as if wee thought them worth nothing, further then they ſerue our owne turnes.</p>
                     <p>But now let vs learne, that it is a neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for vs to praiſe the Lord, for ſhewing himſelfe ſeuere, as well as gentle, for exerciſing his rigor, as well as his grace, and for making knowne his hatred of ſinne, as well as his loue of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Praiſe thou him, for that as hee doth fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accept the meaneſt endeuours of the true-hearted; ſo he will by no meanes be deceiued, by the glorious oſtentation of hypocrites: praiſe him, for that as he will not let a man, that in truth of charity doth giue a cup of cold water, to loſe his reward; ſo he will not reſpect him, that out of other reſpects, deſtitute of charity, ſhall giue all his goods to the poore. Praiſe him, that as hee doth accept and requite the poore widowes mite, that came from ſoundneſſe of deuotion; ſo did hee nothing heed nor affect the rich and pompous bounty of the wealthier perſons, that ſerued their Idoll of vaine-glory, in ſeeming to make their offerings vnto him Praiſe him, for that as he highly prizeth the neglected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ſeruices of thoſe that are ſound in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſo hee doth count thoſe things no better then abomination, that ſeeme glorious in the eyes of men, when they are done for ſiniſter ends.</p>

                     <p> We doe obſerue in Princes, as well their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and iuſtice, in finding out, and taking and executing the crafty offenders that liue vnder their charge, as in ſhewing bounty, and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and courteſie towards their better ſubiects. If a King haue declared himſelfe to be ſo wholly deuoted to right and equity, that if his neereſt fauorites doe things worthy of death, or bonds, hee will not ſpare them, and that no gifts nor bribes can purchaſe fauour for thoſe that are bold to build their faultineſſe vpon ſuch hopes of impunity: how doe the preſent liuers honour him, how doe they applaud his vprightneſſe, and giue him all the titles of honour that they can inuent? yea, how doe thoſe that write ſuch hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, inlarge their words and diſcourſes in his commendation, and aduance him to the skies, for the moſt hearty louer, and conſtant follower of equity that might bee? Why ſhould not the King of Kings enioy the praiſes of the iuſt and ſeuere executions that hee hath done, and daily doth vpon the hollow-hearted? Though men call themſelues after his name, though they make long prayers, though they profeſſe great loue, and feare of him, and make a ſhew of much deuotion, though they preach him in the ſtreets, and worke miracles in his name, and make as if they were the beſt affected to him and his honour that can be; yet when hee comes to them, and ſees them deſtitute of a true godly conuerſation, not ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformed in heart, not vniuerſally obedient in life, not vpright hearted, he makes no more adoe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20394:99"/>but cuts them off by the ſword of iuſtice, and ſweepes them away with the beſome of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Why doe wee not extoll the name of the Lord, in theſe workes of his hand? why doe we not open our mouthes to ſhew forth his praiſe, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and vpright are thy iudgements: and thou haſt troden downe all them that erre from thy ſtatutes, for their deceit is falſhood, and thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like droſſe: and my fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth for feare of thee; and I am afraid of thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for thou doſt iudge the world with equity, and the people with righteouſneſſe.</hi> If a Iudge doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himſelfe diſcreetly, for the ſearching out of a matter, and doe cleerly lay open a cunning pack of cloſely contriued villany, all that heare him, applaud him, and praiſe his prudence and great vnderſtanding, as they did <hi>Salomons,</hi> in the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult caſe of the two harlots, about the dead, and liuing childe. Now when the Lord doth order matters with ſo great diſcretion, as to bring to light the wickedneſſe of the hypocrite, which he with ſuch exceeding cunningneſſe of skill, and ſhifting and turning doth ſtriue to hold vnder darkneſſe, and to keepe from the knowledge of men and Angels, yea often of himſelfe (and of God too, if he could go beyond the Lord) ſhould not the ſeeing and hearing of theſe moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgements of the Lord, cauſe vs to breake forth into his praiſes, and to honour and feare him as a Iudge, before whom it is to no purpoſe to double and to wind? Yea if a man incompaſſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20394:100"/>with deceitfull and hollow meaning ſycophants, who ſeeke by all ſmoothneſſe of behauiour to make him thinke well of them, and account them among the number of his friends, ſhall yet with ſo happy an inſight, diſcerne their falſhood, as that he doe not at all ſuffer himſelfe to reſt vpon them, or to be beguiled in them: doe not wee commend ſuch a man, for his wiſdome and care, and wonder at his prudence and circumſpection? The Hypocrite is one of Gods flatterers, hee would faine win fauour with God, by ſeeming and ſhewes, and worke himſelfe into Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, by a ſmooth behauiour of his outſide: but it will not be, the Lord lookes into the bottome of his ſoule, perceiues all his trickes, plainly fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that he doth but flatter, and therfore quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcardeth and puniſheth him. Why doe wee not returne vnto him the glory of his deepe and all-ſearching wiſedome, and magnifie his name for his infiniteneſſe in that excellent property, whereof a drop or a ſhadow rather in a creature, doth take vs with ſuch approuing and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that wee cannot chuſe but extoll it? Know therefore that from hell, as well as from heauen, we are to fetch matter of thankeſgiuing, and by the damned as wel as the ſaued, to grow acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gods moſt holy properties, and to loue, feare and honour him for them. Princes and Iudges are in great reputation for their wiſdome and iuſtice, as well as for their mercy and bounty: and ſo muſt the Prince of princes, and the Iudge of Iudges.</p>

Let this terrible ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings be admitted into your very ſoules, and if it may be, by maine force ſhake you out of your hard-heartedneſſe and preſumption.

Hee that is very ſorry for diuers faults, and mendeth diuers. He that comes to Church forwardly, and gladly heareth, and gladly practiſeth many things he heareth. He that loueth preaching, and Preachers, and will bid both Miniſters and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men welcome to his houſe and table. Hee that can pray in his family, and likes well to reade in the Bible: he that can weepe at a Sermon, and bee much moued at the reproofes of ſinne: hee that liues vnrebukeable to the worldward, and feareth not the face of any accuſer: hee that is counted zealous for the Lord, and is hot againſt diuers diſorders and abuſes of the times: hee whom almoſt all men take to bee in the way to heauen, and that accounts himſelfe euen

Oh hard ſpeech will ſome man ſay, and who can receiue it I confeſſe indeed, it is an hard ſpeech vnto the diſſembler whom it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but not leſſe true then hard; and therefore all ye that be but Hypocrites, will ye not ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the hearing of theſe tidings, and euen tremble before the Lord, and before his Word? You may perhaps deſire to bee informed more particularly who the men be, that muſt bee thus horribly &amp; fearfully deſtroyed, euen as a dreame when a man awaketh, and that notwithſtanding their doing of all the forenamed good things. I anſwere you out of that, that you haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, all that are conceited of themſelues, and deſpiſe others, turning the knowledge and goodneſſe they haue, into matter of pride and lifting vp themſelues. All thoſe that neuer blinch at euill thoughts within, if their ſinnes come no further then to thought, and euen pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in wicked imaginations which they dare not act: all that are bold to ſinne in ſecret, and care not for it, ſecurely and ſorrowleſly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame things in the darke, which they would not for a world ſhould bee knowne vnto the world. All that are bitter in crying out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinnes of other men, and in aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wrongs and vnkindneſſes they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:

All that hate their enemies in their hearts, and cannot abide to forgiue and doe good vnto their wrongdoers: all that hear much, and it may be alſo repeare it with others, but like vncleane beaſts that chew not the cud, neuer care to muze and ponder vpon it alone, and to turne it into a prayer, and apply it vnto themſelues: all that haue not the diſpoſitions of their hearts changed, and their affections ſet vpon God, though their outſide ſeeme neuer ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: all that allow themſelues in any knowne ſin, extenuating it as little, and flattering, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing themſelues, and neglecting to take care of amendment, becauſe they thinke that no man can chuſe but doe as bad as that commeth vnto. And in one word, all that ſee not, feele not, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not, reſiſt not, and purge not away the guile and deceitfulneſſe of their owne hearts. All, and each of thoſe that are found ſuch, for all their many prayers, much hearing, faire blade, and good hopes, ſhall ſooner or later, by tentations, or afflictions, or allurements of pleaſure, profit, or credit, or fame, or other meanes, be drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the goodneſſe they make ſhew of, and at laſt be ſurely and irrecouerably damned. It is in vaine to flatter your ſelues, and ſay, you hope the matter is not ſo bad as I would ſet it forth to be, and that God will be more mercifull then ſo. Nay brethren, the Lord will not bee more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20394:102"/>mercifull, then may ſtand with his iuſtice and truth, he ſhould be vnrighteous and vnholy, if hee ſhould not caſt into hell fire any of thoſe kindes of men to whom any of thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that I haue ſet downe vnto you.

Princes often threaten, meerly to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, and pronounce harder ſentences in publike, then they meane ſhall be executed, as they doe with vs in caſe of thoſe that are adiudged to bee preſſed to death. It is not ſo with the Iudge of all the world, not one tittle of a word more is to be found in his ſentence, then ſhall be felt in his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: his blowes ſhall bee as terrible as his threats, and his iuſt menaces as exactly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as his moſt gracious promiſes: not one tittle of the Word of God ſhall faile, (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no part of the miſery denounced againſt Hypocrites) till all bee fulfilled. Marke then, I pray you, the preciſe and punctuall dealing of our Lord in this place: hee ſaith particularly, <hi>euery branch,</hi> loe, euery one, without any partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and exception: and <hi>(He)</hi> the God of heauen, that hath a ſtrong arme, and (no queſtion) a knife ſharpe enough for this buſineſſe, and <hi>cutteth off,</hi> taketh quite away, vtterly remoueth from the root, and all the benefits of the root, euen to his endleſſe deſtruction, as it muſt needs be granted: for what but damnation can betide him that is ſeparated from Ieſus the author of life, by whoſe Name alone ſaluation is to be found? Wherfore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20394:103"/>take no more paines to flatter thine owne ſoule, and make thy ſelfe hope to ſpeed better then thou haſt heard; whoſoeuer thou bee whom the forenamed things haue diſcouered to bee but a diſſembler, thou ſhalt ſurely haue thy portion without, amongſt the ſearefull, and dogs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, and theeues, and whoremongers, in that fiery, and yet darke Lake, that is prouided for the faireſt Hypocrites, as well as for the blacker, and more infamous ſinner: there is no eſcaping, there is no getting out; no one Hypocrite ſhall bee able to ſhun the eye and hand of God, hee will picke out euery one by himſelfe, and euery one ſhall be cut off, and vtterly deſtroyed; the Word ſhall proue an axe, affliction ſhall proue an axe, proſperity ſhall proue an axe, and all Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and all that thou doeſt, and all that thou ſeeſt and heareſt, and is done to thee, ſhall be but in the nature of a ſharpe cutting knife, by little and little to take thee off from Chriſt, and ripen thee for vengeance. In comming to Church, thou haſteneſt towards hell; in preaching, thou ſpeedeſt towards death; in giuing almes, thou runneſt forwards to hell; in liuing as thou calleſt it, iuſtly, thou doeſt but ſtep a ſtep neerer to hell; all that thou doſt, and all that betideth thee, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to increaſe and further thy damnation. O miſerable man, and beyond all conceit wretched, vnleſſe thou wilt heare, and feare, and prepare thy ſelfe to come out of this miſery, by feeling it! Be thou cut off from the Vine, be thou ſpiritually excommunicated from Chriſt; let thy ſinnes bee

But I hope. I haue ſo plainely deciphered this child of hell, this ſonne of Satan, the Hypocrite, as that I hope none of Gods true Saints ſhall catch any harme, by hearing them thus proſecuted with feares, and terrours, and threats, from whom they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue themſelues to bee thus manifeſtly differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I ſay, not euery one, in whom much, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much hypocriſie, (and many very bad effects of very much hypocriſie) is to be found, ſhall be damned; but euery Hypocrite in whom this ſin ruleth, and ſhewes it ſelfe to beare-rule, by not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20394:104"/>being ſeene and bewailed, and oppoſed, and the other notes before ſet downe; euery ſuch one, I ſay, and ſay it againe, vnleſſe hee become new, ſhall ſurely be damned. But if the true-hearted, out of his weakneſſe, ſhall be put into ſome feare, by the hearing of this terrour, (ſo that hee doe ſeaſonably returne to inioy comfort) it will doe him good, and not harme, to bee ſo feared: for theſe cauſeleſſe feares of the vpright, proceed from the want of vprightneſſe, though not from the vtter abſence of it, and from the too much hypocriſie, though not ouer-ruling hypocriſie that is in them. And ſo, if for a while they bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen almoſt out of conceit with themſelues as with Hypocrites, till theſe doubts haue made them more bitterly to lament, and heartily to confeſſe, and mightily to fight againſt their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, they ſhall receiue none other euil by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been ſo frighted, then the being purged from that, that was the cauſe of their feares. And if through the ſmalneſſe of the quantity of truth and ſincerity, they cannot ſo euidently perceiue it at the firſt, but that they ſee cauſe to become ſuſpitious of themſelues, the grieuing for the want of truth, and labouring and praying for increaſe of it, which the holy Ghoſt will work in them, by meanes of ſuch ſuſpitions; will bee helpfull (though accidentally, as the beſieging of a City to its fortification) to the growth of their vprightneſſe. But the truth is, that this aptneſſe to fall into iealouſie of ones ſelfe, and when ſuch terrours are deliuered to feare, leſt they belong
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20394:104"/>to him, and ſo framing ones ſelfe to be humbled, becauſe ſo many fruits of much hollowneſſe are ſeene in him as doe miniſter matter to ſuch feare: this aptneſſe, I ſay, to feare, is euen as ſure a ſigne of one that is not an Hypocrite, as can bee named. I would not wiſh a better proofe of ones not being dead, then to heare him complaining, that ſure he is but a dead man: neither can one likely finde a truer note of one that is not dead in this ſinne of hypocriſie, then when the worke of the Word, in the reprehenſions and menaces thereof, doth driue him to complaints and feares of his owne guilefulneſſe, onely ſo, that he be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to prayer and confeſſion heereby, and ſo to ſeeke ſtrength againſt the miſchiefe feared. But on the other ſide, a worſe, and more likely ſigne of a man wholy ſold ouer into the hands of guile, we can ſcarce meet with, then this, to be vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the hearing of ſuch threats, to haue no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of feare, and doubt, and ſuſpition, nor no troubleſome conceits of his owne eſtate: either ſuch man is ſo abundantly and extraordinarily ſanctified, as that the ouer-euident proofe of his vprightneſſe, doth preſently ſecure him from ſuch thoughts, or elſe he is wholly buryed and bound hand and foot in the hollow graue of guile; and therefore cannot feele it, becauſe hee is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder the power of it. For this is the nature of theſe darke and hidden vices, they are euer the leſſe felt, by how much they doe more ſtrongly preuaile, euen as the pangs of death are leaſt troubleſome, when they haue quite ouercome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20394:105"/>the ſtrength of nature. Wherfore, nothing fearing any danger that may come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true hatred by this earneſtnes, let me yet once againe ſettle vnto thoſe that be diſſemblers, &amp; adiure &amp; proteſt, and call Angels &amp; men, and Chriſt &amp; God, and their owne ſoules, and all things that are, to witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that vnleſſe they wil open their eyes, &amp; ſee themſelues to be in a damnable eſtate, they ſhall ſurely be damned. You may perhaps maruel that we ſhould preſſe the poynt ſo hard: but the cauſe is, we know the Hypocrite to bee the moſt noyſome weed in Gods garden, and faine would we make him ſee his danger, that he might eſcape it. Yea, we know that hypocriſie doth harden, and deadden the hart aboue all other ſins, &amp; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world is more difficult, then to make him ſee and feele his perill, who will rather thinke any man, yea all men Hypocrites, then himſelfe, (although by this his ouer-aptneſſe to thinke ſo hardly of others, &amp; hardnes to be made conceiue ſo hardly, though truly of himſelfe, he might, if he were not blind, diſcerne himſelfe to be as hee is.) But now if thou beeſt ſuch, and ſo proued by what hath been formerly ſpoken, how good ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou haſt been to ſee to, and beeſt ſtill: how full ſoeuer of knowledge, and of zeale, blazing outward: how glad ſoeuer to God, and heare Sermons: how able ſoeuer to pray, and to repeat Sermons: how well ſoeuer accounted of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by thy ſelfe: and how ſtrongly ſoeuer perfwaded, and in that perſwaſion ioyed of thy being Gods child, and being ſaued: (as all this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20394:105"/>may befall thee, and yet the former notes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee to be but hollow.) I doe now in Gods name adiudge thee, and preiudge thee, vnleſſe thou repent, to cutting off, to burning, to eternall death, lo, here is the portion of thy cup: At length Gods arme and axe ſhall fell thee, and grub thee vp by the roots, if thou wert as tall as the Cedar of Lebanon, and as tough as the Oakes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan, and as ſtrongly rooted, as the tree that groweth neere a rocke.</p>

It is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion which we wiſh, O all yee that haue been diſſemblers; and your reformation, which wee aime at, which we are well aſſured, can neuer bee effected, but by ſhewing you the woe which is comming vpon you. Now therefore, ſeeing the caſe of counterfeit Chriſtians is ſo bad, ſo hard, ſo intolerably, ſo deſperately, ſo ineuitably
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20394:106"/>wretched, but by turning; wee beſeech you ſuffer your ſelues to be wrought vpon, to be conuerted, to become true, and to receiue the Spirit of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, which the Lord of heauen is now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to powre forth vpon you. Be it knowne vnto thee, O thou that haſt been hither to but an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, that thy caſe is not altogether irrecoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but that thou maiſt, if thou wilt not at this time alſo refuſe Gods gracious offer, bee made ſincere, and ſo bee receiued into grace. For bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ye well aſſured of this truth, that when the Lord of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſends his ſeruants vnto you, in his owne name, to call vpon you to performe any good duty, tending to your owne ſaluation, that then he is alſo preſent in his ordinance, by the gracious cooperation of his good Spirit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you with ſtrength from himſelfe to performe that duty. For Gods ordinances are not idle, neither ſhall his VVord returne in vaine, but ſhall be effectuall for all for which hee ſendeth it, and he that deſireth not the death of the ſinner, but rather that he may turne and liue, will effectually turne him from his euill way, if he doe not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harden himſelfe therein, and euen refuſe to be conuerted. Be willing therefore to be made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that thou maiſt be ſo indeed, and be it for certaine deliuered vnto thy ſoule, that thou ſhalt bee made able to become ſuch, if thou doe not ſtiffen thy ſelfe in the naturall vnwillingneſſe of thy corrupted nature. I demand therfore of thee in the ſame queſtion that our Sauiour vſed to the ſicke man that lay at the Poole of Betheſda, <hi>Wilt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20394:106"/>thou be made whole?</hi> If thou be willing, now the waters are ſtirred, now the Spirit of God is come downe in this ordinance, now thou mayeſt bee put into theſe waters, and now thou ſhalt bee made whole. If thine anſwere bee, that thou art willing, then I ſay vnto thee, make it appeare that thou art ſo in very truth, and that thou doſt not onely ſay thou art ſo: for many a mans words and meaning are farre diſtant each from other: many a man affirmeth with loud voyce, and open profeſſion of ſpeeches, that hee is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that grace which hee is not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
                     <p>There is a faint motion of the will, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an act of the vnderſtanding conuinced, that one ſhould be willing to get a thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any true and earneſt working of the will towards that thing; and this kind of willingneſſe muſt men take for a true being willing. But heerein they doe much deceiue themſelues; for a man may bee inforced to acknowledge, that hee ought to bee willing to get ſuch or ſuch a thing, and withall, finde in himſelfe ſome ſlothfull wiſhes to haue the ſame, and yet be deſtitute of that ſtedfaſt and fixed reſolution of the will, which is indeed the motion of the will required to be in vs, if we will receiue good from the Lord. But how ſhall it be made manifeſt whether a mans willingneſſe bee ſettled or ouert, well grounded or ſhallow? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that indeed bendeth his will to any thing, will be contented to deuoure the paines of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtriuing after it, as he that would be rich
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20394:107"/>in good carrieſt will labour for riches. But hee whoſe will is a little weakly ſtird towards wealth, but yet doth giue it ſelfe ouer vnto eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, after hee hath affirmed that hee would bee wealthy, ſhewes, that his will is not ſettled vpon wealth, by taking his eaſe, and following his pleaſure, rather then that he will croſſe himſelfe in theſe things to get wealth. It is euen ſo in things ſpirituall for this matter, as it is in things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: hee that weakly wiſheth to bee vpright, but hath not his will ſoundly carryed after vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, after his ſeeming to be willing, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth his vnwillingneſſe, by refuſing to doe that by which he might be made vpright. But if thou wouldeſt indeed be made ſincere, as a ſicke man would be made whole, thou muſt be content to take that phyſicke, though troubleſome in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which will purge out thy predominant hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and beget ſincerity in the ſtead thereof.</p>
                     <p>Giue mee leaue therefore to goe forward in this buſineſſe, and to ſhew vnto you by what meanes the Hypocrite may preuaile againſt his guile,<note place="margin">Meanes by which the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may be made vpright.</note> that hitherto hath preuailed againſt him; and he that hath had nothing but ſhewes, may be made ſound and ſubſtantiall.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> To ſee and confeſſe that he bath been an Hypocrite hitherto.</note> In the firſt place then, he muſt ſee and confeſſe himſelfe to haue bin hitherto but an Hypocrite, &amp; muſt ſuffer the Word of God to make him known vnto himſelf.</p>
                     <p>This is the firſt and hardeſt piece of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of which it may be ſaid, that hee hath halfe ended which hath well begun, and without which it ſhall be impoſſible euer to make any good and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20394:107"/>fruitfull end in this matter. For though the groſſe Hypocrite knowes himſelfe but to diſſemble, yet (ſuch is the winding deceit of this vice, and ſo true is it that <hi>Salomon</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>The counſels of the wicked are deceit,</hi>) that he will not bee knowne to himſelfe, of that which he doth know. For when I ſay, hee muſt confeſſe it, I meane not that hee muſt in a fit bare lye ſay ſo, or being forced by the power of his conſcience cry out, that ſo it is; but he muſt be willing, though againſt the haire, and the heart too, to minde himſelfe of it, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſeriouſly, to fet the poynt downe certainly within himſelfe, and to affirme againſt himſelfe freely in his owne ſoule, in ſecret, at the barre of his owne conſcience: Ah, I am an Hypocrite, a Phariſe, a diſſembler, a dry branch. An inward, hearty, ſecret, plaine, free acknowledgement of ones guile, grounded vpon diligent enquiry, ſound ſearch, due conuiction, &amp; plaine euidence, is the firſt thing that muſt be done for the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of hypocriſie, without which it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to get the better of it. A man muſt ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with all ſeriouſneſſe, as in a matter of the greateſt importance in the world, euen that whereupon his eternall eſtate doth depend, to finde out his owne falſhood; and hauing with ſome paines of ſeeking, perceiued ſuch and ſuch notes of ouer-ruling deceitfulneſſe within him, muſt ſet downe and caſt out all ſelfe-louing, and ſelfe-flattering fancies of former times, (whereby he was better perſwaded of himſelfe, or at leaſt did put off the thought &amp; remembrance of this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20394:108"/>matter) and ſay vnto himſelfe, Ah, now I haue met with this coozening deceiuer Hypocriſie, which hath all this while beguiled mee, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized ouer mee, vnſeene and vndiſcerned. Now I ſee by my careleſneſſe of pondring on Gods Word, which I heare and ſpeake of, and yet not condemning my ſelfe for ſuch negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: Now I ſee by mine vncontrolled cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of others, now I ſee, by my letting euill thoughts and ſecret ſinnes paſſe away without lamenting; by my excuſing and leſſening mine owne faults, and making nothing of that, that I am not willing to mend, and caſting the fault ſtill vpon others, rather then my ſelfe, that I am not ſound at heart, yea, that I am ſtarke hollow and rotten at heart. This hunting out, and arraigning, and conuicting of the ſinne we ſpeake againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the barre of a mans owne heart; this muſt needs be done, if euer we will ſubdue and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter the ſame. And why? why I ſay, O thou man or woman whoſoeuer, ſhouldeſt thou bee vnwilling to ſee and confeſſe thy guile within the walles of thine owne ſoule, before the eyes of God, that doe already ſee it plaine enough? This confeſſion is not required of thee, as an euidence to be produced againſt thee, for thy eaſier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but as a neceſſary antecedent of thy pardon, which none can obtaine from God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he plead guilty: for it is an ouer-ruled caſe in heauen, and ſhall neuer bee altered or ſwarued from, No man ſhall be forgiuen from Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, but he that askes pardon; and no man can
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20394:108"/>aske pardon, that doth not acknowledge guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I ſay then againe vnto thee, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not bee vnwilling to ſee and confeſſe that which thou ſhalt haue none hurt by confeſſing: yea, which in very truth it is vtterly in vaine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to confeſſe; for deny it whileſt thou wilt, from the eyes of God, the Husbandman, and from the eyes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the root of this Vine, no denyall, no couering can hide it; when colouring and denying cannot keepe the fault ſecret, and plaine acknowledgement may get the fault pardoned; would any but a very foole, or obſtinate and wilfull man, that had vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeeke his owne ruine, refuſe to confeſſe? I doe not wiſh thee with open voyce (ſo as men ſhould heare it to thy reproch) to cauſe thine owne mouth charge thee with guile, (which in truth were ſomewhat hard, and yet not ſo hard, but that a wiſe man would readily doe it to get remiſſion) but alone in the ſecret thoughts of thine owne breſt, or in the ſecret prayers of thy cloſet betwixt God and thy ſelfe, where none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eare ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare, but his, that is already acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the matter, and knowes more then thou canſt confeſſe, but alone heere, I ſay, to ſigh out thine humble acknowledgement, and ſay, O wretched man I, to this moment I haue but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and ſeemed to be good, without being ſo. Alacke, I am (I will no longer be ignorant, or deny, or not heed it, that I am) an Hypocrite, I finde I am not changed in heart, ſome ſinne I think too pleaſant, or gainfull, or needfull to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20394:109"/>ſome duty too hard or expencefull to performe; I neuer yet accuſtomed to take the paines of binding the law of wiſedome vpon the tables of mine heart; I neuer yet regarded to feele the power of Religion mortifying my moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued luſts, and framing my very ſoule to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: I neuer heretofore did feele and bewaile mine hollowneſſe; and therefore, Ah, it muſt no longer be gainſaid by me, I am an Hypocrite. In truth, brethren, you muſt needs doe thus, or elſe ye ſhall for euer remaine Hypocrites. Were it not better for thee thus to ſhame thy ſelfe before Chriſt, then to make him ſhame thee before the whole world at the laſt Iudgement, or make thee ſhame thy ſelfe to no purpoſe, before many on thy death-bed? Euery ſecret thing muſt be made open, euery hidden thing muſt bee brought to light. O now drag this corner-ſeeking, and light-ſhining vice into the open view, by a free and plaine confeſsion as thou haſt beene exhorted, that it may not at that day remaine to bee laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thine eternall confuſion. If thou telleſt me that thou haſt bin long time a profeſſour of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; haſt long accounted thy ſelf the child of God; &amp; therfore if the matter be brought to that paſſe, that after all this while thou muſt be faine to take vpon thee the name of an Hypocrite, thou canſt not ſee any hope of euer being true. I anſwere thee, that this is a vaine feare, with which Satan ſeekes to hinder thee from doing that that is abſolutely needfull to thy ſaluation: for this is one, and a principall cauſe that thou
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20394:109"/>waſt neuer yet true, becauſe thou wouldeſt neuer yet be made to ſee thy felſe falſe. But remoue this impediment (by the much perſwaded confeſſion I call for at thine hands) and whatſoeuer thou haſt been, and how long ſoeuer thou ſhalt bee made true; for God comes hither now in this his ordinance, to make thee true, if thou doe not make thy ſelfe vncapable of truth, by refuſing to acknowledge thy want of truth: wherefore brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thorow all vnwillingneſſe and delayes, and laying aſide all ſhifts and defences, fall vpon thy knees in thy ſecret chamber, and there ſay vnto thy ſelfe, and in more words complaine againſt thy ſelfe vnto God, that thou art as yet an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, a barren branch, that ſtandeth euery houre in perill of being cut off.</p>
                     <p>This done,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> A conſtant lamenting of his hypocriſie.</note> in the ſecond place frame thy ſelfe to mourning and ſorrow for thine hypocriſie, and ferret out thy guile by lamenting it. For there is no ſinne or corruption in the heart of man, ſo tyrannous and ouer-ruling, but that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow will fetch it downe and ouer-maſter it. Indeed a little whimpering griefe, a ſigh or two, a teare or two, a ſad countenance for a Sermon time or ſo, will not preuaile. The beſt medicine that is, will not heale a ſore, if there bee not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of it applyed, if it bee not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly applyed and followed cloſe. He that will be content to grieue a little at Church, or ſo, for his guile, and out of the preſent euidence of the Spirit working with the Word, will perhaps yeeld to ſee and to lament his hollowneſſe, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20394:110"/>lets the matter paſſe quickly, and takes no more paines about it, ſhall anger the ſore, as it were, and not heale it, and by careleſſe neglecting of Gods grace in ſuch motions offered, hee ſhall cauſe his hypocriſie to feſter more, and grow more incurable: for euen this weake worke of the Word will helpe (out of his owne erronious diſpoſition) to coozen him, and to make him too ſoone thinke himſelfe vpright, and ſo he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer become vpright. But the ſorrow I ſpeake of, muſt be a ſettled and conſtant ſorrow, which a man muſt let reſt vpon his ſoule, and willingly entertaine within himſelfe many a day together, though not in a violent manner to hinder his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions, yet in a ſtill quiet maner, to make his thoughts in the middeſt of all other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as well they may, without offering any wrong vnto ſuch occaſions) be ſtill running vpon the matter of his guile, and in an inward and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner continuing to bemone the ſame within himſelfe. A ſpirit of griefe will not change an Hypocrite into a true Chriſtian, a conſtant griefe will. This then doe, (as he that hath a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſore or wound, applies the curing of that wound aboue all things, vntill it be whole) ſet thy ſelfe for a good ſpace of time together, to make it thy principal worke to obſerue the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thine hypocriſie, and to bewaile the ſame. Sometimes be earneſt with thy ſelfe, and in thy ſolemne and ſecret prayers and confeſſions, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to rend and breake thine heart with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſorrow, and to bee wonderfull vile in thine
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20394:110"/>owne eyes, becauſe of thy long continued hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie: and ſtriue to doe as <hi>Peter</hi> did for his deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Maſter, (for a counterfeit following him, is little better then a denyall of him) euen to get alone and weepe, (at leaſt grieue, which may well be without weeping) very bitterly: and when thine other occaſions call thee from thy chamber, yet hold thy thoughts ſtill on worke (and let the plaiſter lye to the ſore all the day.) Be thinking, Ah wretched creature I, that haue ſo great a ſpace of time continued an Hypocrite, a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of Religion, not changed in heart, not waſhed in the inner man, not made a new creature! O how great cauſe hath God to abhorre me, haue I to abhorre my ſelfe, that haue ſo long gone about to coozen God, and to mocke mine owne ſoule! And ſo whatſoeuer thou beeſt doing, let thine heart bee feeding on this bitter herbe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly bemoning thy guile and thine irrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſſe, and vnchangedneſſe of heart. Bid theſe cogitations welcome as thou ſitteſt at meate, and count them as the beſt ſawce for thy meat, yea, as the beſt diſh on thy table. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany let theſe cogitations be thy moſt eſteemed companions, and in ſolitarineſſe giue thy ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to them, and ſo continue to doe, till thou find a plaine change of thine heart, a manifeſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo euident a framing thee to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thou waſt before, that at laſt thou mayeſt be able, (which if thou wilt not be weary of ſtriuing, within no long ſpace of time thou ſhalt be able to ſay) Now I finde and feele, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20394:111"/>I am made new. Brethren, if any of you had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore leg, or arme, he would be content to goe to ſome Chirurgion, to dreſſe the ſame euery morning and euening, and let (perhaps) a ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting plaiſter lye vpon it all day long, and all night too, for three weekes, or a moneths ſpace together, that he might be healed and not loſe his ioynt. O why ſhould not he that hath an heart diſeaſed with that grieuous fiſtula of hypocriſie, be contented, as it were, to dreſſe it twice a day, by ſome ſolemne, ſecret, and earneſt lamenting it before God, and to let the plaiſter of griefe lye at it all day, by frequent renewing of his ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts for it, that this foule and feſtered ſore may be healed, and he may not loſe his ſoule and body both by it? Wilt thou not beſtow as much time, paines, care, in healing thy ſoule, as thy leg or arme? Doubtleſſe this care would goe happily forward, for God himſelfe would be the Chirurgion, and health would follow without faile; for the medicine is ſoueraigne, and hath been tryed by many, and preſcribed by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and skilfull perſon. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> bids wauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-minded and double-hearted men, hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Hypocrites, to turne their laughter into teares, and to afflict themſelues and weepe: loe how affliction, griefe, ſighs teares, be the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of this medicine that will kill hypocriſie! Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after God had met him going to Damaſcus, tooke this medicine carefully, and in the ſpace of three dayes it healed him cleane, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and made him of a proud hypocriticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20394:111"/>Phariſe, to become a moſt true-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſincere Apoſtle and Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. For, comming to Damaſcus, he neither ate nor dranke for three dayes, but gaue himſelfe to mourne for his hollowneſſe, bloodineſſe, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and other ſinnes, and ſo was healed of all at once. O happy medicine! O ſpeedy and bleſſed cure! O bleſſed griefe! O the moſt gainfully ſpent three dayes that euer were ſpent, to worke ſuch an alteration in ſuch a ſoule! Wilt not thou take the ſame courſe, that did good to one ſo farre gone with guile? O now ſettle thy ſelfe to mourne for thy guile, that thou maiſt be healed, and maiſt be comforted. But ſome man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſay, that it is not ſo eaſie a matter to ſoften an hard heart. I anſwere, It is not indeed, but it is a poſſible matter, and that it may bee effected through Gods bleſſing with carefull indeuours, from which Gods bleſſing will neuer bee kept backe.<note place="margin">

Say, O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitable (but by repentance, whereof ſorrow is a neceſſary companion) and how extreme is the perill wherein I ſtand! If I caſt not out this guile out of mine heart, it will certainly keepe me out of heauen; if I keepe it ſtill in my ſoule, it will ſurely caſt me downe to hell. I muſt, I muſt of neceſſity, (becauſe of the truth of God that hath ſaid it, and his iuſtice that hates this ſinne) be damned euerlaſtingly, and for euer fry in thoſe vnquenchable flames (which none can ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſwallowed vp of their torment) vnleſſe I be changed, and of an Hypocrite as I haue bin, become ſound at heart.

We cannot ouercome the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt corruptions of our hart in our owne ſtrength, but it muſt be a diuine power, which muſt inable vs to preuaile againſt ſinfull diſpoſitions. Now this ſtrength the Lord of heauen, the ſtrong God, the author of all ſtrength, is ready and willing to beſtow vpon all that humbly ſue vnto him for it, for he giueth to all liberally, and hitteth no man in the teeth. Beg then for the ſpirit of power, and of a right mind, and beg heartily and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe thou beggeſt of him that is able to giue, and much more willing, then thou art to receiue. He that hath made others of weake, to become ſtrong, and of falſe, to become true, can, and will performe the ſame grace to thee, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe. For hee commandeth all to aske, and ſhuts vp his mercies from none that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heartily beſeech the ſame at his hands. Perhaps the diuell may ſeeke to turne thee from this exerciſe of prayer, by caſting in a cauill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, to this purpoſe, that the prayers of Hypocrites cannot be accepted, and thou hauing been hitherto but an Hypocrite, how ſhould thy prayers preuaile in heauen? For the ſettling of thy ſoule againſt this doubt, know, that the prayer of an Hypocrite that doth not ſee and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his hypocriſie, cannot indeed bee bidden welcome in heauen, but all that are heauy laden
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20394:114"/>with ſinne, haue a command to come vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and a promiſe that they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed: wherefore, now thou hauing begun to ſee, and deteſt, and bee burthened and grieued with thy guile, good warrant haſt thou to aske helpe, and good aſſurance that thine asking ſhall not be in vaine. Therefore I ſay againe, lift vp thine heart and voyce, and cry mightily to God, for the powerfull worke of his Spirit, to make thee ſincere before him. O Lord, ſay thou, which art onely able to forme the ſoule of man anew within, create thou in me a new heart, and forme a right ſpirit within me; make me ſound in thy precepts, and let not iniquity haue dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me. Make me (Lord) a true Iſraelite, in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile. Make mee truly good; good for thy ſake, and becauſe thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue me good that I may pleaſe thee, and not onely or chiefly that I may ſerue mine owne turne, yea or ſaue mine owne ſoule; yea general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vniuerſally good: good in all things, with ſuch a goodnes as thou accounteſt perfect in thy Son Chriſts perfection, becauſe he in whom it is, doth ſtriue &amp; labour after perfection. Follow this ſuit moſt cloſely and earneſtly, and giue not ouer till thou findeſt it granted; &amp; if thou canſt not go on in variety of words, yet repeat ouer the ſame petition often, and often, and be not weary; for ſo they be hearty &amp; feruent, the Lord of heauen will neuer be weary of ſuch repetitions. Our Sauiour hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Parable, to the intent that we ſhuld pray alwayes, and not waxe faint. Thou knoweſt I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20394:114"/>preſume what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parable is. A poore Widdow, by importunity, forced an vnrighteous Iudge to do her iuſtice againſt her aduerſary. How much more ſhall the righteous God auenge the cauſe of his ſeruants that cry day and night vnto him? And if his compaſſion be ſuch towards them, that he will auenge them of their externall enemies, which onely ſeeke to make their liues tedious by perſecutions; ſhall hee not much rather aſſiſt them againſt their inward corruptions, which tend to bring their ſoules to deſtruction? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolue thy ſelfe to be importunate, and to take no nay, nor euer to giue ouer till thou haſt ſped in thy ſuit: wherin nothing can hinder thee from ſpeeding, but thine owne too ſoone giuing ouer the ſuit through wearineſſe. Men are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with earneſtneſſe and importunity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them many times a ſtout begger hath a ſtoutnay, becauſe they condemne it as a matter of impudency, to be a ſtout begger: but to God nothing is more pleaſing, then this ſtirring vp our ſelues to take hold vpon his name, and this giuing him no reſt day nor night till hee heare our prayers; and with him onely faint ſuitors, that will take a repulſe eaſily, and bee ſoone put backe, doe goe away empty of the thing they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. Know then, that thy ſaluation dependeth vpon this matter, and therefore as in a caſe of the greateſt importance in the world, make thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires feruent, and reſolue neuer to ceaſe asking, till thou ſhalt receiue the Spirit of truth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe: And know, that God doth not deny
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20394:115"/>to heare thy prayers at firſt, becauſe he is not able or willing to grant them, or becauſe hee counts it a matter too troubleſome for him, but alone to indeare the benefit obtained, to make thee ſee the worth of it, and become the more thankfull. Pray therefore, and pray feruently, and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: O Lord, create a right ſpirit in me, and make me ſound in thy precepts.</p>

It is alone ignorance of God, that makes vs ſet our ſelues in Gods roome, and aime at our owne benefit in ſtead of his glory. But he that will take paines to cleere vp his owne eyes, and to behold the glory of God, as he hath reuealed it in his Word, and in his Goſpell, ſhall be ſo affected with the ſplendor thereof, as that now he will account nothing worth any thing, but that ſurpaſſing glorious Maieſty, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely excels all things, and ſo hypocriſie muſt needs vaniſh. The knowledge of God will make a man to perceiue how little it ſhall auaile him to diſguize himſelfe. The knowledge of God will make him to ſee how worthy the Lord is of all the ſeruice of all creatures. The knowledge of God will make his heart to become in loue with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20394:115"/>God, and no man will diſſemble with him whom he loueth: wherefore labour to get, and to grow in this knowledge, by a frequent pondering and muſing vpon the nature of God, and beholding in his Temple the beauty of his Maieſty, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> ſpeaketh. Tell thy ſelfe often of his infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eternity, and that all things are from him, and by him, and for him, and hee alone is from and of himſelfe. Say vnto thy ſoule, hee is the owner of all things, and the ruler of all things. All the good properties of all creatures be but drops of his ſea, and ſparkes of his flame, and there is infinitely more of all good things in him alone, then in all them; and whatſoeuer is in them, it is more his then theirs, and theirs no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor further, then as he will impart: with him is wiſedome, with him is power, greatneſſe, and riches, and Maieſty, and dominion are his. Hee is infinitely iuſt, and righteous, hating ſinne with ten thouſand times more vehement hatred then wee can thinke hee doth, and puniſheth it with ten thouſand times more ſeuerity then wee can thinke he will. He is thorowly and thorowly acquainted with all that is in man, &amp; needeth not to receiue information from any other. His eyes in euery place behold the euill and the good, and he is moſt fearefull and terrible to the ſinner, and euen farre more burning then any conſuming fire. Put thy ſelfe therefore in mind frequently, of his all-ſearching eye, all-hearing eare, almighty hand, and euery-where-preſent preſence. Say with <hi>Dauid, Lord, whither ſhall I goe out of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:20394:116"/>And <hi>thou compaſſeſt my path, and my lying downe, and art acquainted with all my wayes.</hi> He that will thus ſet his mind on worke, often to muze of Gods excellencies, ſhall finde the candle of the knowledge of God to bee lighted vp within his ſoule. And as a theefe endureth not the light, and therefore if a candle be tinded, he flies: ſo this ſlie theefe of hypocriſie will bee gone, if we ſet vp and renew this burning lampe of knowledge within vs. Wherefore gather together ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy texts of Scripture, as tend to ſet foorth God vnto vs, and beſtow much time in pondering of them, and telling thine heart how true they bee, and moſt inconceiueably great and good hee is that hath in them diſcouered but his backe parts vnto thee; and thou ſhalt ſoone finde, that the beames of this Sunne will diſpell the fogs of guile within thee.<note place="margin">

Hypocriſie cannot preuaile, but where a man doth ſuffer himſelfe to paſſe on careleſly &amp; heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly thorow the world, not regarding much how matters goe with his ſoule, nor caring to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Gods preſence, and conſider how he hath behaued himſelfe towards God. He that lets his reckonings runne on a long time without ſetting
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20394:116"/>them in order, or conſidering how they ſtand, is many times a very banquerupt, and knowes it not; but hee that doth often make his accounts euen, doth likely keep before-hand. We muſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt vp our accounts with God, we muſt daily reckon with him and our ſelues for our debts and arrerages. But eſpecially a man muſt haue a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye vnto that moſt beloued ſinne of his, which he takes moſt delight in, is moſt prone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and is lotheſt to ſee and leaue, and moſt watchfully marke and obſerue each ſtirring, and turning, and mouing of it within his ſoule, be it what it will bee, worldlineſſe, paſſion, reuenge, vaine-glory, luſt, voluptuouſneſſe, carking, or the like. Likely hypocriſie, that is it ſelfe a cloſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and loues not to bee ſeene, hath ſome lieutenant, as it were, ſome maſter-ſin, that keepes its place openly, and holds vp its dominion. See this, oppoſe this, ſubdue this, and the raigne of guile is ouerthrowne. This ferreting out of all ſinne by the Law, and chiefly of the maſter-ſinne; this frequent appearing before God to try our daily conuerſation in his preſence, will cauſe that a man ſhall not bee vnder the dominion of guile. He ſhal diſcouer ſo much hypocriſie, and ſo much hurt comming to him by hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and ſo much good by the purging out of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, that by confeſſing and oppoſing it, hee ſhall gaine certaine freedome from the tyranny and vſurpation thereof.</p>
                     <p>Lo, brethren, ſo many of you as haue hitherto beene ſeruants to guile, I haue reuealed vnto you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20394:117"/>the meanes of recouering your liberty. Doe theſe things, and though you haue been to this time arrant hypocrites, you ſhall be changed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vpright. Onely doe theſe things now for the preſent, from this time forward, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring or delaying, without putting off the Lord vntill another time: for the plaiſter will come too late when the ſore is paſt cure: After a man is dead, make him a cawdle, ſaith the Prouerbe. This is madneſſe indeed; when God hath ſo long borne with thy diſſimulation, as that now hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues to beare with thee no longer, nor euer to pardon thee, and therefore turnes thy conſcience looſe vpon thee to purſue thee, as he did on <hi>Iudas,</hi> then ſhalt thou bee vnable to doe theſe things, and then ſhalt thou finde it paſt time a day to thinke of reforming thy guile, when God is now in cutting thee off for it: for the night will come when no man can work, as Chriſt telleth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now at the pure reproofes of Gods Word, and at the gentle and louing motions of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, addreſſe thy ſelfe to this, though painfull, yet happy and needfull labour of reforming thy guile; and I proteſt vnto thee in the name of the Lord, that thou ſhalt preuaile. See thine hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, grieue for it before God, conſidering the certaine and inſufferable danger of it, and the aſſurance of eſcaping it by this meanes, and euen falling out with thy ſelfe, becauſe thou canſt not grieue more for it, and withall, pray earneſtly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for his Spirit: meditate much of his excellencies and preſence, and vſe to marke and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20394:117"/>examine thy life daily, chiefly in reſpect of thy moſt deare ſinne which thou findeſt thy ſelfe lotheſt to ſee, and leaue, and then heare thou the Word of the Lord vnto thee, Thy ſinne ſhall be pardoned, thy guile ſhall be remoued, and thou ſhalt (from this time forward) become a liuing and a fruitfull branch. O how happy ſhall this change be? how comfortable this alteration? and how ſhalt thou bleſſe the time, the day, the meanes, the cauſe that ſo changed thee? And now I pray you, brethren, giue mee leaue yet a little further to preſſe this exhortation vpon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Anſwere each of you within himſelfe, and ſay, What is thy reſolution, and what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou to doe? Wilt thou paſſe ouer this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as careleſly as thou haſt already done many others? and goe as fruitleſly from this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as from others heretofore; neuer regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to amend the ſin which the Word of God diſcouereth vnto thee to bee ſo miſchieuous? wilt thou, I ſay, euen neglect and ſet light by this admonition, and euen forget it ſo ſoone as thy backe is turned on the Church, and neuer take care of following it? or wilt thou heed it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, follow it, and now begin to make thy ſelfe a true Chriſtian, by purging out the former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preuailing guile of thy ſoule? Come to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, before thou goeſt hence, what thou wilt doe, whether obey the Word of God, or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, practiſe it, or let it ſlide, without endeuour to practiſe. Me thinkes it ſhould not be poſſible that any amongſt you ſhould haue an heart ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20394:118"/>deſperately hardened as not to obſerue an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo neerly concerning him, and ſo much and earneſtly beaten vpon him. Me thinkes it cannot be that any marking it, ſhould poſſibly ſettle himſelfe in a wilfull obſtinacy of going on as he hath begun, and not mending ſo damnable a ſinne. All the way that Satan hath to make you loſe the fruit of this exhortation, is to nuzzle you in a good conceit, that ſure you bee not Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but already true-hearted: and therefore the exhortation, though needfull, yet is to you impertinent. But thou muſt vnderſtand, that though thou beeſt not a ranke Hypocrite, yet the things deliuered concerne thee, and are needfull for thee alſo, as well as for him that is. For there is none of all Gods Saints ſo perfectly renewed, but that a great deale of the leauen of hypocriſie may be found in him, though not ſo much as by quite ouercomming him, ſhould giue him the name of an Hypocrite, yet ſo much as by often breaking foorth in him, may iuſtly cauſe him to take heed and beware of hypocriſie, as our Sauiour Chriſt biddeth.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſame things that are auailable to beate downe any vice from bearing rule in the heart, the ſame things are alſo needfull for the further and further weakening of it, that it may bee leſſe and leſſe noyſome to the heart. Wherefore howſoeuer the caſe goe with thee, thou haſt a portion in this worke; if thou knoweſt thy ſelfe to haue been but an Hypocrite, moſt of all doth it appertaine to thee to practiſe it, that

                     <p>The poynt then is fully proued, needing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none other confirmation, then the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall experience of all Gods Saints agreeable to the Word of God. But for your better ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the matter, wee will ſhew you, both the cauſe why it is ſo, and the reaſon why it ſtandeth better with the wiſedome of God to appoynt it ſo to be, rather then otherwiſe. For without all doubt, the Lord could giue vs perfection of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in this life, if ſo it ſeemed good vnto his wiſedome. And the cauſe of it is,<note place="margin">The cauſe of our not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect here, is our not being fully vnited to Chriſt.</note> our not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully and perfectly vnited vnto Chriſt Ieſus our Head, from whom all graces are deriued, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20394:121"/>water from the fountaine. If we were conioyned to Chriſt in the higheſt degree of vnion, wee ſhould alſo be voyd of ſinne. For as in our vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> wee did ſo wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his corrupt image, that there remained no good thing in vs: ſo in our vniting to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhould ſo wholly be filled with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image, as to haue none euill abiding in vs. But whileſt we remaine in this world, wee haue not a full poſſeſſion of him, wee are not ſo neerly vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him. Wee are like a maid contracted, eſpouſed, made ſure to a man, which hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible right into him, and hath receiued diuers tokens, euen rich tokens of loue, to aſſure her of the marriage in due time, but is not yet married vnto him, nor is put into the poſſeſſion of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eſtate wholly and fully, as at the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of matrimony. And this alſo ariſeth hence, that hee is a glorious, incorruptible, immortall and ſpirituall Man; we are mortall, corruptible, meane, and naturall men, and ſo weak, feeble and imperfect a thing, as a mortall vnnaturall man, though it may in ſome degree be ioyned vnto ſo glorious a nature and perſon as that of Chriſts, (namely, in reſpect of a certaine right and intereſt into him, and of the receiuing of ſome firſt-fruits and benefits from him) yet cannot be admitted into a full, and whole, &amp; perfect coniunction with him, namely, ſo far, as to ſee him as it is ſeene, and know him as it is known, and to be all in all with him. Now ſo exceeding deeply doth the ſtaine of ſinne cleaue vnto vs, which we haue receiued
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20394:121"/>from our firſt parent <hi>Adam,</hi> that an vnion of leſſe cloſeneſſe then this, euen of wholly poſſeſſing Chriſt, and being wholly poſſeſſed by Chriſt, will not ſerue the turne wholly and altogether to expell the corruptions of our hearts. You ſee now whence it comes, that in this life we remaine obnoxious to diuers imperfections.</p>
                     <p>Next,<note place="margin">Reaſons why God will not giue vs a totall freedome from ſinne heere.</note> let vs conſider why the Lord of heauen will haue it to be ſo, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwiſe. In truth it ſhould be an intolerable preſumption and ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe in vs, to demand a reaſon of Gods acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if himſelfe did not vouchſafe to ſtoope ſo low, as to render vs a reaſon thereof himſelfe. But in this matter the Scripture ſaith plainly, that God hath ſhut all vnder ſinne, that hee might haue mercy vpon all. Doubtleſſe this is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be vnderſtood of giuing ouer man to bee ſinfull in his firſt corruption, ſhewing the reaſon why God did permit and appoynt it ſo to be: but withall, it may very fitly ſerue to informe vs in the preſent matter, ſhewing why the Lord doth pleaſe to leaue euen his owne ſeruants, after their ingraffing into Chriſt, vnto the ſinfulneſſe of their nature, ſo farre, that they ſhall not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from it; namely,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> That it may moſt manifeſtly appeare we are ſaued of grace.</note> that it might moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare that they be ſaued of grace, and not of merit, and that he may fully and vnqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inioy the praiſe of hauing giuen it them of free will and bounty, not paid it them as a thing earned by the worthineſſe of their workes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in another reſpect, the Lord pleaſeth to call it a wages, <hi>viz.</hi> (not in regard that it is giuen
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20394:122"/>for the dignity of the workes, but) becauſe of the certainty of ſuch an ouer-abundant requitall. For as an honeſt man will ſurely pay his labourer his hire (according to the Law,) ſo the Lord will ſurely giue eternall life vnto his ſeruants, that by continuance in well doing doe labour for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now ſeeing the Lord did principally aime at his owne glory, in giuing ſaluation vnto men; it is moſt agreeable to reaſon, that he ſhould in ſuch ſort bring them vnto ſaluation, as may moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the riches of his mercy, the glory whereof he doth moſt affect and ſeeke in that worke: and it is a more cleere demonſtration of mercy, to giue them ſaluation, through the iuſtification which is by faith in Chriſt, notwithſtanding that themſelues remaine very weake, feeble, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſinfull, and vnable to performe exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Law, then if he ſhould at the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their regeneration, free them wholly from all weakneſſe, and after a life ſpent in all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of obedience, and in perfect freedome from ſinne, crowne them in the end with eternall glory: for ſuch vnſpotted holineſſe of life might carry a ſhew of claiming life for the dignity thereof, but the guiltineſſe of manifold weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes doth ſtop the mouth of euery man before the Lord, and forceth all that haue any wit in their heads, and feeling in their hearts, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they are freely ſaued by his grace, and that of his owne will, not by the workes which they had done.</p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20394:122"/>
                     <p> Secondly, the Lords will is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> That we may be conformable to Chriſt in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and goe to heauen the ſame rough way that he did.</note> to make vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſt our Head, and to goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſame way that he went before vs; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through manifold afflictions, that ſo out of the ſence and feeling of the burthen of ſinne, and out of our long and troubleſome wreſtling with it, we might be become more heartily and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly thankfull vnto him for our deliuerance. Therefore the Apoſtle tels vs that we muſt ſuffer with Chriſt, before we can raigne with him; and himſelfe tels vs, that whoſoeuer will be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt take vp his croſſe and follow him; for he will haue triall of the loue, fortitude, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of his ſouldiers, and ſee whether for his ſake they will endure the conflict, afore he ſet the Crowne vpon their heads. Now if he ſhould not leaue vs in a ſtate ſubiect to ſome ſinne, we could not be ſubiect to any affliction: for where there is no fault imputed to be puniſhed, nor none in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to be purged, there it ſhould bee vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the Lord, to lay any puniſhment: for iuſtice will not ſuffer that the creature bee made ſubiect to correction, where hee is not ſubiect to blame. Hence the Lord of heauen, that would haue vs pledge our Sauiour in the bitter cup of ſorrowes on earth, before we feaſt with him, with the new wine of conſolation in his Kingdome, hath left the reliques of our fleſh in vs to exerciſe vs, that though ſinne haue not dominion ouer vs, yet it hath a dwelling and working in vs, as the remnants of the Cananites kept vnder tribute. If any ſhall obiect within himſelfe, How can it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20394:123"/>be, that creatures ſo full of ſinne, ſhould poſſibly be vnited vnto Chriſt? how can it agree with his holineſſe, to take men and women defiled with corruption, and make them ſo neere vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone? (for ſo we are made vnto him in this life.) The anſwere is ready, that the fruitfull branches, at the time of their ingraffing into Chriſt, are made partakers of the bleſſing ſpoken of by <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the Pſalme, viz. Their tranſgreſſion is remitted, their ſinne is couered, and the Lord imputeth not iniquity vnto them. Through the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe vnto them, and acceptation thereof for them, all their ſinnes are made as if they were not, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly hinder them from being in their meaſure vnited vnto Chriſt, and reconciled vnto God. For all the ſinnes of the penitent beleeuers, that euer they haue committed, or ſhall commit, are (in reſpect of God) fully and wholly forgiuen, and quite done away; God pronouncing them perfectly iuſt in his ſight, and not imputing to them any iniquity at all: whence it muſt needs follow, as from the next and immediate ground thereof, that they ſhall neuer fall away from grace: for God can neuer pronounce him vniuſt, whom hee hath once pronounced iuſt; nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer impute iniquity to him againe, to whom once hee imputed none iniquity, becauſe this were a manifeſt change and alteration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is no ſhadow at all in God. And ſo you haue this poynt ſufficiently cleered.</p>

No obedience can poſſibly merit in any kind of meriting, but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, abſolute, and perfect. For the life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Law, cannot bee chalenged by vertue of the Law, vnleſſe the condition, whereupon the Law doth promiſe it, bee wholly, and in euery part and particle fulfilled: ſeeing if one man make a couenant with another of giuing him ſuch a reward, vpon condition that he doe goe to ſuch a place, and diſpatch (for example) foure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall buſineſſes: the man with whom this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is made, cannot, by vertue of the bargaine, chalenge from the bargaine-maker, the reward ſpecified, if he goe to the place and diſpatch but halfe the buſineſſes, or all, or any of them but by the halues: for a conditionall promiſe, in reaſon and equity, bindeth not the promiſe-maker, but vpon the perfect fulfilling of the worke for which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20394:124"/>the promiſe was made. Now the Law, the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by which we muſt chalenge life, if wee will ſtand vpon any kind of merit, ſaith, Doe this, and liue, and that we may know its meaning to bee, do it fully, perfectly, exactly, without any failing; it explicates it ſelfe, ſaying, Curſed bee the man that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them. Wherefore by vertue of the Law, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worth and deſert of the workes thereof, no man can lay claime to life, vnleſſe hee can ſay, I haue done this, I haue confirmed the whole Law to doe it. Now whoſoeuer hath ſinnes and corruptions, and diſorders in him, whoſoeuer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in many things, whoſoeuer doth the euill he would not, cannot ſay that he eſtabliſheth the whole Law by doing it: and our poynt hath made it plaine, that the beſt of all Gods Saints the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Paul, Iames, Iohn, Peter</hi> not excepted, (and I hope, none will be bold to thinke himſelfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then theſe pillars) muſt bee faine to confeſſe that they tranſgreſſe in many things, and muſt not dare to ſay that they haue no ſinne in this life; wherefore it followes ineuitably, plainly, cleerly, incontrollably, to any reaſonable mans vnderſtanding, that they can in no ſort lay claime to heauen, by any manner of worth, or deſeruing of their workes. And in very deed, the Papiſts themſelues are faine to yeeld vs this cauſe in ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a cloſe manner, and with a faire couer of words, that they may not ſeeme to yeeld it. For they tell vs, that theſe workes of the Saints are dipt in the blood of Chriſt, and ſo being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

For there is (I thinke) none of vs which denyeth, but that God accepting our workes as perfect in Chriſt, doth reward vs for them, as if they were perfect; but ſeeing the reward becomes due in Chriſt, and not by the workes themſelues, wee thinke it a fooliſh pride to maintaine the ſtately name of merit of workes, when wee are faine to beg the reward for anothers ſake, and cannot chalenge it ſimply for the workes ſake.</p>

And ſo leaue the fond, deceiued, and ſelfe-conceited

But the cauſe is manifeſt: hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is alwayes accompanied with pride; and the growth of hypocriſie breeds alſo a growth of pride, and pride ſwels out the eyes, that a man cannot ſee the cleereſt truthes.</p>

Impatient folkes are many times ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with worldly croſſes, (made ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome vnto them alone by their owne folly and pride, whereby they neglect to ſee God, and to ſtoope vnto him in croſſes) that they are euen altogether weary of their liues becauſe of them, and our of a kind of ſtomackfull ſullenneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, as once <hi>Ionas,</hi> or elſe a feeble ſinking vnder the burthen of miſery, as once <hi>Eliah;</hi> they euen thinke with themſelues, I would I were dead, and are bold to trouble God with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauoury petition of making an end of their daies, that they may be rid of their croſſes: which they haue neither patience enough to beare for the preſent, nor hope enough to looke for a good iſſue out of, for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>But (my brethren) conſider, Haue you not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and worſe things to be weary of, then croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and for which, if for any thing, to be weary of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20394:127"/>life alſo, as of a burthen, which you long to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from off your ſhoulders? Haſt thou not pride, paſſion, worldlineſſe, ambition, luſt, enuie, vaine-glory, blindneſſe, hollowneſſe, deadneſſe of heart, and a thouſand more, beſides theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within thee, which giue thee farre iuſter cauſe of panting for the period of thy dayes, and wiſhing that thy life heere might bee but ſhort, then the frowardneſſe of a yoke fellow, the ſtubbornneſſe of a child, the meanneſſe of thine eſtate, the falſeneſſe of thy friends, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and fury of thine enemies, or any other croſſe (if any be) worſe then theſe? Ah, wee haue not ſufficiently informed our ſelues of the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe of ſin, neither are we ſufficiently heauie laden with the ſenſe thereof, if the cumberſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this doe not cauſe vs, euen in the time of our greateſt immunity from other miſeries, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet our departure hence. If ſickneſſes make men cry for death, becauſe they be terrible to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; how ſhould not the ſickneſſes of the ſoule make vs much rather to ſeeke for it, ſeeing wee ſhall not ceaſe to ſuffer the fits of this diſeaſe, till death be ſent to ſeuer our ſoules from our bodies, and both from our corruptions? But death at once with a moſt happy paricide (as I may terme it) kils both it ſelfe, our laſt foe, and ſinne its mother, our firſt foe, and ſorrow its ſiſter, our daily foe. That one pang which puls away the ſoule from the body, doth alſo pull away ſinne both from the ſoule and the body. O moſt deſireable pang, and worthy to be thirſted after, more then any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20394:128"/>thing. <hi>Iob,</hi> when his body was full of botches, could ſay with much vehemency of paſſion, <hi>Why dyed I not from the wombe? why gaue I not vp the ghoſt when I came out of the belly? then ſhould I haue lyen ſtill and beene quiet, I ſhould haue ſlept, then had I been at reſt.</hi> Hee could in elegancy of ſpeech commend death, and ſay, There the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ceaſe from troubling, and there the weary be at reſt; there the priſoners reſt together, and heare not the voyce of the oppreſſour; yea hee ſaith, that a miſerable man would long for it, and dig for it more then for hid treaſures, and would reioyce exceedingly, and be glad if he could find it.</p>
                     <p>This impatiency of life is no way worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: it ſauours too much of ſelfe loue, to be good and allowable. But if, out of an holy impatiency of ſinne, wee could as feelingly take vp ſpeeches of a like nature, O how truly might it witneſſe with vs, that we did hate ſinne, that we were enemies to the luſts of our hearts, that our corruptions were to vs as impriſonment, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, paine, captiuity, and ſo that wee were ſure of our part in Chriſts goodneſſe, who comes to preach liberty vnto the captiues! Verily our ſoules are as full of hotches, many of them, as <hi>Iobs</hi> body; and it will hardly bee better with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs, ſo long as we abide in theſe earthly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles; were we as full of ſpirituall life, as hee of naturall, and our ſoules as truly indued with holineſſe, as his body with ſenſe, we ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of this burthen with much bitterneſſe, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20394:128"/>ſay, O that I could tell where to ſeeke death! O that I might finde the graue, and come to thoſe quiet regions, where worldlineſſe and pride, and wrath ſhall no more torment mee, and where my will ſhall be no more carryed away with any fleſhly perturbation! I confeſſe, that this is the leaſt part of the good that death bringeth vnto the Saints, that it doth vtterly diſmiſſe them from the ſeruitude of the fleſh; but were we ſo thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall as we ſhould be, this would ſeeme of ſo great worth with vs, as wee would preferre it before all that the world counts delightfull. The Bridegroome would rather go to his graue, then to his bride-chamber; the traueller would rather lye downe in his bed of earth, then in a bed of downe; and euery man would bee of <hi>Salomons</hi> minde, and count the day of death better then the day of birth. I confeſſe that wee muſt ſo farre reſigne our willes to Gods will, as with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe of minde to weare out the dayes of our apprentiſhip and pilgrimage. For ſo long as God hath any ſeruice for vs to doe any where, though the place and company be full of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, yet ſhould wee force our willes to doe him ſeruice, with our owne diſquietment; but yet a vertuous deſire of being ſeparated from this vnhappy condition of life (wherein wee ſhall neuer fully be ſeparated from the ſinne that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſo faſt) would be very commendable, and very profitable. The gavvdes of this vvorld vvould not ſo eaſily beguile vs, the cumbers of this vvorld vvould not ſo frettingly gawle vs, if
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20394:129"/>wee did diſ-ſweeten the one, with making our ſelues to taſte the bitterneſſe of our ſinne, and diſ-imbitter the other, with feeling the far greater bitterneſſe of that which is as farre more harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then it, as lead is heauier then corke. Then ſhould wee proue our ſelues to bee men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a diſcerning ſpirit, that can know, of things, what is good, what is bad; and of bad things, what is more, what is leſſe bad. Then ſhould we ſhew our ſelues to approch neere that height of grace which the bleſſed Apoſtle had, who in relating of bonds, impriſonment, hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe, whipping, ſtocking, ſhipwrack, and daily dying, neuer burſts forth into lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but rather recounts with ioy, that which was ſo painfull to ſuffer; and ſeemeth to bee glad of life, for nothing elſe, but that (by ſuffering more of thoſe troubles) hee might doe more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the Church, and honour to Chriſt: but when he hath occaſion to declare his ſinfulneſſe, the body of death, the law of his members, the rebellion of his fleſh, then onely is heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing and crying out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this body?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let therefore the feeling of ſinne make our deſires ſo earneſt after full freedome from it, that we may for this cauſe euen breathe after death, (when there are none other aduerſities to diſtaſte the comforts of this life vnto vs) that by it wee ſhall be ſet at liberty from the diuels tentations, the worlds affrightments &amp; allurements, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the corrupt luſts which we both doe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20394:129"/>and whileſt we lodge in this dungeon, ſhall carry about with vs. And let each of vs ſay often to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, O that I were parted from husband and wife, from children, from friends, from lands and goods, and from this world, and all that in this world is counted worth hauing, ſo that I might alſo bee parted from my corruptions, and neuer more hereafter ſtand in need of pruning! Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer will purge, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will cleanſe, and all Gods ordinances, and all our Chriſtian indeuours will helpe to lop off theſe diſordered paſſions that are within vs. But this is alone a cleanſing in part, a paring off ſome euill, and leauing much behind: onely the laſt blow of death will make a full riddance of all that is euill in vs; and after that blow giuen, there ſhall nothing remaine behinde that may call for any more purging. This is the ſoueraigne medicine that will conſummate the cure of our diſeaſed ſoules, which, till then, ſhall neuer bee deliuered from all diſeaſes, though wee bee in Chriſt as the Vine, and haue God the Father for our Husbandman. O then, Lord, ſend thou this laſt enemy, which may doe mee more good, then all the former friends I meet with can doe, euen worke a diſſolution of my ſoule from my body, and of my ſinne from them both. Let it come, Lord, let it come ſpeedily, doe thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it in due ſeaſon, and take away all ſinne, by taking away this life of nature, to make way for a farre more excellent life of glory. Deſire of death is then only warrantable, when a deſire of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20394:130"/>Gods full preſence, and of ſinnes perfect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, be the cauſes mouing that deſire.</p>

For though we ſhall ſtill remaine ſo feeble, as to ſinne in many things, for all our labor to the contrary; yet our labour againſt corruption ſhall not be in vaine, becauſe by vertue of it, we ſhall make ſinne much weaker then elſe it would be, and ſaue our ſelues from many ſinnes which elſe wee ſhould fall into. A beſieged City keepes its gates faſt locked, and the walls well manned, and neuer giues ouer watching and warding, ſo long as the enemies army doth ingirt it: ſo though it receiue ſome damage, and loſe many men, yet the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies army cannot breake in vpon them, and take the City, and kill all the inhabitants, or make them captiues. Our corruptions incompaſſe our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20394:130"/>ſoules round; if we ceaſe to bee watchfull, and to be ready in armes, they will preuaile againſt our ſoules, and bring vs to deſtruction, or very neere vnto it, but by reſiſting with all diligence, wee ſhall be ſafe from this vtmoſt miſchiefe. Some diſeaſes will ſtay with mens bodies for terme of life, but by keeping good diet, and other good meanes, a man may ſaue himſelfe from much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and eſcape many a ſore fit, which cannot but follow from his careleſneſſe. So our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maladies will breake forth leſſer and ſeldomer, and put vs to leſſe miſery by farre, if wee keepe a good dyet, and vſe other good waies of helping our ſoules againſt them. Hee that goes in a foule way, ſhall meet with ſome ſpots of dirt, though he be neuer ſo wary in chuſing his wayes, yet he ſhall not be all mire and dirt, as he that is heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and goes thorow thicke and thinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making difference. Some ſtaines alſo our ſoules will gather, in our paſſage thorow this dirty world, but nothing ſo many and great, if we picke our way, as otherwiſe. Groſſe, foule, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, infamous ſinnes may be ſhunned, all finnes may be leſſened, and cauſed to breake out ſeldomer, and in lower degrees, if conſidering our aptneſſe to them, wee beſtirre our ſelues to keepe them vnder. Be we wiſe therefore for our ſoules, as we would be for our bodies and ſtates, and ſeeing we cannot be without corruptions, let vs hold them in ſubiection, as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for who can tell to what height they may grow, and what miſchiefe they may doe vs, if our
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20394:131"/>diligence this way be wanting. But me thinkes it ſhould not be neceſſary to vſe more words in perſwading a Chriſtian man to ſtriue againſt his corruptions: they be ſo contrary to the life of grace that is in him, and ſo oppoſite to that new nature which the Lord hath infuſed into him in the time of his regeneration, that he can no more chuſe to oppoſe them in ſome meaſure, then a man can chuſe whether he will ſtriue againſt that that offers to ſtop his breath.</p>
                     <p>A man, out of an inſtinct of nature to preſerue himſelfe, ſtands ſo diſpoſed, that he findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moued without deliberation, (euen out of an vndenyable principle that alwayes beareth ſway in his minde and will) to thruſt away from him things that offer to cut the body, or ſlay it, or rob it of life. The eye will winke and ſhut its lids when a man thinkes not of it, if any thing offer to come neere that might be offenſiue vnto it. It is none otherwiſe in the life of grace: he that hath it, findes in himſelfe (euen as it were a maine principle that beareth rule in his whole ſoule, when he thinkes not of it in particular) that hee cannot but be an enemy vnto ſinne, hee cannot but beare a grudge againſt it, and wiſh, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the rooting of it out of his heart, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it hard in, from breaking foorth in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Alone there be diuers Saints of God that want skill to doe that which grace doth put in them a perpetuall inclination to doe. Wherefore I will be bold (not to make ſo large a diſcourſe of this matter as the thing requireth, but) to giue
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20394:131"/>you ſome three or foure ſpecial directions, which in following, you ſhall finde your ſelues much helped againſt theſe remnants of ſinne which moue within you. The firſt rule is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>Let a man frequently ſtirre vp in himſelfe thoughts of diſlike, grieſe, ſorrow, loathing,<note place="margin">Directions to helpe againſt all ſinne. <hi>1.</hi> Stirre vp in our ſelues often thoughts of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, diſlike of our ſelues for ſinnes paſt.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and diſ-eſteeming himſelfe for the ſins he hath committed in any kind, and ſpecially for ſuch groſſer ſinnes as he hath falne into, and ſuch as he findes himſelfe moſt apt and likely to fall into againe. For hee that can make himſelfe vile in his owne eyes, for euils paſt, and can bring his heart to a due abhorring of himſelfe for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes already perpetrated, and euen looke backe vpon them with loathing and abomination, is moſt likely to be kept from running into them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. For this is euen a puniſhing and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of himſelfe, and a taking of a moſt iuſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of himſelfe for them; and wee know that the force of puniſhment is, to bridle and reſtraine offenders, and keepe them from offending any more afterwards. In ſo doing, hee doth as one would ſay, whip and ſcourge his owne heart, and exerciſe ſeuerity againſt himſelfe, which cannot but cauſe him to ſtand alienated from the ſame faults afterwards, as he that is whipped or ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by another, is thereby made more carefull, not to make bold in that kind againe. So the Prophet hauing offended through impatient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining againſt the proſperity of the ſinner, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh himſelfe to an abhorring and abaſing of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20394:132"/>himſelfe for it, ſaying, <hi>So fooliſh was I, and vnwiſe, and euen as a beaſt before thee.</hi> And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth make himſelfe contemptible in his owne eyes for his perſecution of the Saints, ſaying, <hi>I am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Saints of God.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am vile, I haue ſpoken once and againe, but I will adde no more:</hi> and after againe, <hi>I abhor my ſelfe.</hi> And theſe thoughts and motions a Chriſtian man muſt not alone purſue with more largeneſſe and earneſtneſſe in his folemne and ſet meditations, as he ſhall finde opportunity; but muſt euer and anon (as he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about his ordinary affaires, and is conuerſant in worldly buſineſſes, and occaſioned by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to call to remembrance any fault of his) bee ſaying within himſelfe, Ah vile ſinfull wretch and hate-worthy creature that I am, haue not I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt God, and mine owne ſoule, in ſuch paſſionateneſſe, ſuch wantonneſſe, ſuch vniuſtice, and the like? O that I could euen deteſt my ſelfe for this; who but a very beaſt or foole, would haue been ſo often and ſo groſſely ouertaken? It is not poſſible to imagine, vnleſſe one doe take experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his owne practice, how much the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this holy anger againſt a mans ſelfe for ſinnes paſt, will ſtrengthen him againſt the ſame, and abate the power of thoſe corruptions of his heart, which brake foorth into ſuch rebellion. Wherefore doe thus often, many times, many ſcore times in a day, put thy ſelfe in mind, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall offer it ſelfe, of thy former ſinnes, with a riſing of thy ſoule, againſt thy ſelfe, and with an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20394:132"/>holy kind of ſharpneſſe and tartneſſe, being euen out of loue and conceit with thy ſelfe, ſaying, Ah vile creature, how could I finde in mine heart to do ſuch things? would any man haue thought it poſſible for any creature from whom all piety and reaſon both were not baniſhed, to runne out into ſuch words, ſuch deeds? and what is wanting to the length and largeneſſe of theſe cogitations throughout the day, in regard of the interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other affaires, that labour to ſupply by their oftenneſſe, and by their earneſt working within thee, cloſing ſtill with a turning away of thy liking from them, and a wiſhing that thou hadſt neuer ſo offended God.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> Renew often in thy ſelfe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of no more commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy moſt pleaſing ſinnes.</note> let a good man hold alwayes faſt within himſelfe a reſolution of not committing ſuch and ſuch ſinnes as he is moſt apt to commit, and in regard of his condition, calling, place, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily temper, or the like, is moſt in danger to commit; and let him often reuiue in himſelfe alſo thoughts and motions to that end, ſaying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, Wel, through Gods gracious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what euer come of mee, I will no more tranſgreſſe the Law of God, and diſpleaſe him in ſuch and ſuch offences. Should the creature wrong the Creator, and the child doe iniury to the father? Nothing is more vnreaſonable then that I ſhould for any thing, ſinne againſt my ſtrength and my Redeemer: of my ſelfe I cannot ceaſe to ſinne; but God will worke in mee both the will and the deed: and doubtleſſe by his help I will not ſinne in ſuch kind, meaſure, manner,

I will no more bee ſo fooliſhly wanton, nor vſe ſuch euill and defiling ſpeeches and behauiours. I will neuer be ſo impatient and diſcontented againe. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth this remedy againſt ſin, and vſeth the phraſe of being arm'd with it, becauſe a Chriſtian ſoule, ſo long as it remaineth peremptory in this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, is like a ſouldier clad in ſtrong harneſſe, who though he bee ſmitten at and receiueth a blow, yet through the faithfulneſſe of his armour is defended from the piercing of the weapon, and from the wound. If Satan, or the fleſh ſuggeſt a motion, or preſent an occaſion of doing ſuch euils, as a man hath often ſaid within himſelfe, Well, by Gods grace nothing ſhall euer make me doe it; the will hauing bent it ſelfe fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch things in generall, flings away from this particular motion, and reiecteth it with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine. Wherefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (as I was in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) commendeth this matter vnto vs, in theſe words: <hi>For as much as Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs in the fleſh, arme your ſelues with the ſame minde, that he who hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſinne, that hee no longer ſhould liue the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</hi> You ſee how a Chriſtian ſhould goe fenced; well, I will no longer follow ſin, nor doe after the corrupt luſts of men, but the holy will of God. And you ſee alſo by what argument, preſſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe, a Chriſtian ſhould fortifie this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20394:133"/>determination in himſelfe, namely, becauſe Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs.</p>
                     <p>And this determination muſt not alone bee proſecuted more plentifully and earneſtly in our ſettled and ſolemne meditations, but perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo renewed and confirmed, euen as wee goe about our other affaires: for a mans hand may be working in his calling, and his heart drawing it ſelfe to the maine worke of his calling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, by lifting vp it ſelfe with ſuch thoughts as occaſion may offer it ſelfe. Surely that ſinne that ſlew Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, is too vile a thing in it ſelfe, too hatefull to God, too hurtfull to the committer, for a Chriſtian man to liue in, or once to practiſe: and therefore what-euer may befall, I will not commit ſuch, and ſuch, and ſuch a ſinne, naming that, that the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall giue him moſt cauſe to name, or that his heart hath moſt reaſon to be moſt carefull of ſhunning. And this a good man ſhould doe, not once, twice, or thrice in a weeke, but euer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, twenty, and twice twenty times in a day, in halfe a day. For though we liue in the world, yet our maine buſineſſe is to trauell towards heauen; and therefore the ſoule muſt take all occaſions of furniſhing it ſelfe with thoughts that tend to further it in that iourney.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20394:134"/>by raiſing vp ſome holy affection of loathing the fault, griefe for it, anger againſt it; or elſe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Gods holy preſence, feare of his fierce anger, trembling at his iuſt threats, or elſe by ſending vp ſome preſent and ſhort requeſt vnto God, for the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, ſaying, Lord, helpe me with thy grace, ſhould I euer doe ſo vile or fruitleſſe things? nay, ſhould I ſuffer the cogitations of them to dwell in my ſoule? God forbid. Lord, ſtrengthen me by thy Spirit, that I may not diſhonour and offend thee by ſuch words, ſuch actions. Thus the Spirit by luſting againſt the fleſh, ſhall mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. Yea, and if it ſo fall out that theſe ſhorter eiaculations, or briefe petitions of the ſoule will not ſerue the turne, but that the motions grow more thicke or vehement, and the heart begins almoſt to conſent vnto them, and ſo we find our ſelues on the loſing hand, (for when once the will hath giuen ground, by either thinking, Why ſhould I not doe it? or by making but a faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall, a mans ſoule is foyled; and if occaſion bee not for the preſent committing of it, yet the next time occaſion doth come, vnleſſe he haue gotten more ſtrength, and armed his will more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will ſoone bee drawne to commit it;) I ſay, when wee thus perceiue corruption ſtrong, and grace weake, we muſt take ſo much care of our ſoules, as if it bee poſſible to lay all other things aſide, and in the ſolemneſt manner fall on praying to God for ſtrength againſt that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if other occaſions ſtand ſo auerſe, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20394:134"/>we cannot haue time or place to make a ſolemne prayer, yet we muſt double and redouble the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and grones of our heart, thinking within our ſelues, O heauenly Father, thou ſeeſt I am weake, and I feele I am yeelding, and ſinne is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to get the vpper hand; O ſtrengthen me with grace, ſtrengthen me with thy power, and let thy Spirit rule in me, &amp; cruſh downe theſe foule paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for thy mercy ſake; and if yet the euill thought follow him, as oft it will, he muſt not be weary of renewing the ſame requeſts, ſaying, O I muſt not yeeld, I will not yeeld, but, Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee I cannot reſiſt; Lord, beat downe for me theſe wicked deſires and inclinations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy promiſe, and ſo ſtill (though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without exceeding much weariſomeneſſe of Spirit) continuing to raiſe vp holy wiſhes and holy affections, (ſeeking and taking the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting alone to his ſolemne prayers) he ſhall be made ſtrong in Ieſus Chriſt, and in the power of his might, and ſhall bee a conqueror ouer the tentation. For (brethren) we muſt conceiue the caſe to ſtand thus with all the members of Chriſt; without him they can doe nothing, and all their ſufficiency is of him: he doth indeed implant in their ſoules, at their firſt regenerating, an ability of turning away their wills from euill things, and of departing from iniquity, but yet ſo, that there is neceſſary to their performing of theſe holy actions, a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall cooperation of his ſanctifying Spirit; and they muſt know that they doe good, and ſhunne
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20394:135"/>euill by a borrowed power, not a power original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in themſelues, and by a borrowed power giuen of grace aboue nature, not dwelling in their nature of it ſelfe. And whileſt they doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this dependance vpon the Lord, by making him their refuge in the time of tentation; and therefore doe not alone ſtirre vp their owne ſtrength, and ſet their owne good affections and deſires on working: but withall, ſend to heauen for aid, and (as vtterly diſtruſting themſelues) implore preſent aſſiſtance from God: (becauſe they doe indeed giue honour vnto God) they ſeldome faile to get the victory: but when in theſe ſpirituall encounters they ſatisfie themſelues with their owne endeuours, and thinke it ſufficient to ſet their owne ſpirituall ſtrength on worke, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting to beg helpe of Gods holy Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a manifeſt demonſtration of ſelfe-confidence, and of a ſpirituall kind of ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe; therefore the Lord, to make them know themſelues, doth withdraw his ſpeciall grace, and ſo, (after a few faint reſiſtances) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they renew not their ſtrength by running vnto him their ſtrength, they are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or other plainly foyled and ouerthrowne. Wherefore we muſt know, that when wee finde the fleſh to abate nothing of his forwardneſſe to euill, by our oppoſing good purpoſes and thoughts againſt it, (yea rather, that it ſeemeth to grow more violent as water, the current of which is ſtopped) then I ſay we muſt know, that the Lord doth now of purpoſe turne Satan,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20394:135"/>with our corruptions vpon vs, that we might find our frailty, and betake ourſelues wholly to him and his might; and then as hauing a ſpeciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſeeke to God, we muſt, as I ſaid aboue, not waxe faint, but double and redouble our deſires; and if that will not ſerue, ſo ſoone as wee can poſſibly get opportunity, addreſſe our ſelues to ſolemne inuocation.</p>
                     <p>Thus doing, wee follow the example of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he was moleſted with a thorne in his fleſh, (me thinkes that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note ſome troubleſome corruption of his owne heart, which is ſaid to be giuen vnto him: becauſe euen poyſon may be giuen in a receit by the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Phyſician) did preſently apply himſelfe to God in prayer for the remouall of it, and ſo was anſwered, that Gods grace ſhould bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him. Wherefore neither let thy thoughts and firſt motions of thy ſoule paſſe away vnob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued or vnreſiſted: neither yet reſiſt them alone in thine owne ſtrength, but ſpy them out ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and preſently oppugne them, partly by ſetting on worke the grace already receiued, partly by requiring a new ſupply of grace: and hee that will make this practice familiar and eaſie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by vſe of doing, ſhall finde by proofe, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable good that will come of it to his ſoule.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20394:136"/>his corruption, occaſions of euill in any kinde. For ſuch is the finfulneſſe of mans euill heart, that euen that which is not in it ſelfe ſinfull, may giue an aduantage to his ſinfulneſſe, and draw him to the committing of ſinne. Theſe things when his experience hath diſcouered vnto him, hee muſt carefully ſhunne and auoyd, and not ſuffer his ouer-free vſe of his liberty to become a ſnare vnto him. Diuers exerciſes, ſports, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, times, places, and other like there are, of which a man cannot ſay preciſely that they bee ſinnes, yet they doe ſo ſtrongly worke vpon the naughtineſſe of the heart, that they doe euen tempt and draw the heart vnto euill: theſe hee that will not reſtraine himſelfe from, ſhall neuer be able to keepe himſelfe vnſpotted of the world, but ſhal be, euen with a kind of force &amp; violence, haled to the committing of wickedneſſe againſt his firmeſt reſolution to the contrary. In vſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a man doth euen lay himſelfe open, &amp; tempt luſt and Satan to tempt him, and tempt the Lord of heauen through his vnbridledneſſe of heart, to deliuer him vp into the hands of tentation; and then how ſhall he chuſe but bee vanquiſhed and ouercome thereof? Wherefore our Sauiour tels vs, that if our hand or foot offend vs, we muſt cut them off and caſt them from vs; yea, if the very eye offend vs, we muſt pull it out and fling it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. His meaning ſeemeth to be, not alone that all, euen the deareſt things that are ſinnes, muſt be abandoned, but euen alſo, that things which allure, prouoke, and ſollicite vs to ſinne, becauſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20394:136"/>of the weakeneſſe of our ſoules, muſt bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe renounced and forſaken, for all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſſe or profit. For hee that doth not ſo much loue holineſſe and innocency, that for the attaining thereof hee can be content to abridge himſelfe of ſome part of his lawfull liberty, ſhall neuer reach to any ſoundneſſe and perfection of holineſſe. Euen as a weake and crazie body, if hee make no choyce of his food, but will indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill his ſtomack with any kind of meate that liketh his appetite, ſhall ſo increaſe the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his body, and ſo ſtrengthen his naturall diſeaſes, that it will bee impoſſible for him to eſcape diuers terrible pangs of them, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhewes vs in bodies ſubiect to the Gowt, or Collick, or to a conſumption, or to the like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady: ſo rightly fareth it with our infirme and ſicke ſoules, ſome ſinleſſe ſports, ſome company not in it ſelfe, or to any other vnlawfull: ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty not to be condemned as wicked, will yet ſo confirme and ſtrengthen certaine peculiar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of ſome mans ſoule more then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the inioying of ſuch contents will proue exceeding miſchieuous, and doe him an hundred times more harme, then the content thereof can be worth vnto him. Bee we therefore as wary and cautelous for our ſpirituall health, as for our naturall: Let vs ſet bounds to our ſelues euen in the vſe of our lawfull liberty in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not pleaſe our ſenſes and fancies, to the wounding and hurting of our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>Now brethren, theſe are the moſt needfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20394:137"/>for the ouermaſtering of the euils of our inward man, which I thought fit to commend vnto you. He that will follow them, ſhall finde a ſenſible decay of the body of death; he ſhall find the fleſh more and more ſubdued vnto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; hee ſhall finde himſelfe able to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe paſſions and luſts, that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought impoſſible to bee preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; he ſhall be kept from many groſſe faults, and many dangerous our-ſtrayings, and ſhall far leſſe frequently, and leſſe violently be foyled of his ſpirituall enemy, then without them, it will prooue or ſeeme poſſible.

For why, it followes hence neceſſarily, that the branches in this Vine ſhould not be appalled nor out of heart, becauſe they are continually troubled with the feeling of many things amiſſe, which it were farre more deſireable to haue lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, then continue vpon them. Heere is cauſe not of not being humbled, but of not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the ſenfe and feeling of our manifold corruptions. For it is ſure, a man may be a lining and a fruitfull branch, and yet ſtand in great need of much pruning. It doth often ariſe in the hearts of the trueſt of Gods people, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt their truth, that they haue ſo many ſinnes ſtill ſtirring in them, and that they doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſgreſſe ſo many waies, and oftentimes in very high degrees, and groſſe kinds.</p>
                     <p>Now if we had well conſulted with the Saints of God that liued in former times, and of whoſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20394:138"/>liues the holy Scriptures doe giue vs a map or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement, we ſhould eaſily perceiue that there were no force at all in this argument, vnleſſe in ſo ſpeaking, we will offend againſt the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods children, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh in another caſe. For what reaſon were ſtrong and good againſt me, or any of you that now liue, the ſame had been alſo firme and ſtrong againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that were members of the Church in former times; and if the Scriptures doe aſſure vs of their being dearly beloued of God, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingraffed into Chriſt, euen at the ſelfe ſame time when they did complaine of like corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to thoſe that wee now doe complaine of: then we may ſafely collect hence, that wee alſo are in Chriſt, and in the fauour of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that wee cannot deny our ſelues to bee polluted with ſuch euils. Wherefore if you will truly conclude of your ſelues in this behalſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be, or be not in Chriſt: you muſt not look ſo much only to what corruptions you haue, as to what you allow. For true grace may ſtand with the hauing of many, but not with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any. He that excuſeth, extenuateth, makes light of any ſinne at all, and thinkes he needs not greatly care for leauing off that, becauſe it is ſo ſmall a matter, and becauſe hee is perſwaded that there is neuer a man aliue but doth as bad; and therefore beares himſelfe boldly vpon Gods miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed mercy, that he ſhall doe well enough for all that he allowes ſinne; hee giues it liberty and licence, and yeelds himſelfe to the dominion of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20394:138"/>ſinne, and this man is not a liuing member of Chriſts body, nor a fruitfull branch of this Vine. Let him by no meanes beguile himſelfe, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any formes of ſeeming goodneſſe that hee hath in other things, to make him conceiue well of himſelfe; he is doubtleſſe an halter, and Chriſt Ieſus will reiect him at laſt. But he that hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes, ſees them, acknowledgeth them to God, hath his ſoule troubled at them, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, rather then his life, to be freed of them, and becomes exceeding baſe in his owne feeling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of them, ſtill caſting himſelfe vpon Gods gracious and free fauour in Chriſt for pardon of them, may be, and is a fruitfull branch, though he haue a thouſand ſinnes of infirmitie in him; yea though he be ouercome of tentation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame ſinne againe and againe.</p>
                     <p>Let not the diuell abuſe any of you, to make him leſſe carefull of lamenting, and oppoſing, and being humbled vnder his ſinnes, becauſe he heares he may be a good Chriſtian, and partake of the benefits of Chriſt for all them: for in ſo abuſing this comfort, you ſhall make your ſelues vncapable of this comfort, becauſe it belongeth alone to thoſe that ſo haue ſinned, as they bee troubled, vexed and diſquieted with it, as with the breaking of a leg or arme, and do euen make haſte to the binding of their ſoules vp againe, by the renewing of their repentance. Indeed the Hypocrite, if he can once get a conceit faſtened in him, that though he doe commit ſuch a ſinne, yet he may goe to heauen well enough for all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20394:139"/>that, he thinketh himſelf ſafe, and is little careful to oppoſe or bewaile that ſinne, which hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits will not damne him: but the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will be no whit leſſe carefull to frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to mourning for ſinne, and to take paines againſt it, becauſe he is ſecured for the matter of damnation. For the thing, in regard of which he doth hate ſinne, and would faine bee rid of it, is neither onely, nor chiefly this, that it is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bring his ſoule to hell: but this alſo, yea this chiefly, that it is offenſiue to God, and diſpleaſeth his louing Father, and makes him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to hold ſuch familiar and friendly ſociety with God, as elſe he might haue. So that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying of this conſolation, to nouriſh ſecurity, preſumption and boldneſſe in ſinning, is a ſore ſigne of a man that is farre enough off from any truth: wherefore, we deſire that none of you ſhould ſo abuſe the ſweet comforts of Gods Word. But make the right and true vſe of this comfort, and lay it like a good plaiſter diſcreetly and ſeaſonably to thy wounded ſoule; and when thy doubting heart, by Satans crafty prompting ſhall tell, that thou art none of Gods, becauſe of ſuch and ſuch faults that thou haſt committed, and doſt often fall into, (and that to this end, that thereby he may cauſe thee to giue ouer all hope, and caſt off all care of praying to God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thy ſoule in confeſſion, and ſuing for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in Chriſt, and ſo to frame thee either to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſperation or vtter looſeneſſe, one of which things muſt neceſſarily-follow vpon the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20394:139"/>of that concluſion:) When, I ſay, Satan is buſie thus to turne thy ſinnes to the ouerthrow of thy faith, and to the turning thee quite out of the way of godlineſſe and peace: now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere by the ſeaſonable remembring, and due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the preſent poynt, No no. O mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing heart! I am full of ſinnes, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them, and am troubled with them. I fall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but I euer riſe, and euer reſolue to riſe to goe to the Lord; and acknowledge, and ſtriue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile them, and to craue and beg his helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them more and more earneſtly. Wherfore I am ſure that thoſe ſinnes cannot diſproue my being a true Chriſtian and a child of God: and therefore I will both call vpon him, and ſtay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and reſoluing ſtill to ſtriue to bee more free from ſinne, will reſt vpon Chriſt, for what I cannot but acknowledge to bee wanting in my ſelfe. To ſee our ſinnes, ſo as to grow vile in our owne eyes, and more and more contemptible in our owne account, and more and more to labour to haue our ſoules contrite and broken for them; this is a good ſight of them, and we muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it: but to ſee them, ſo as to giue ouer hoping in Gods mercy for their pardon, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring againſt them in his ſtrength, becauſe our often foyles and failings do make vs conclude, it is in vaine: this is no way allowable. As good ſcald as burnt, the Prouer be ſaith: As good not ſee our ſinnes at all, as make ſo bad an vſe of the ſight of them. But now, O all ye that are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full branches, keepe faſt your title and intereſt

The Lord is very carefull and ready to helpe his ſeruants againſt the ſinnes of their hearts and liues, and againſt all the euill of their corrupted nature. The moſt High is a partner with a Chriſtian in his combate againſt his luſts; yea the chiefe workman in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of reforming what is amiſſe in him. He will beſtow dreſſing on his ſheepe, whiting on his linnen, weeding on his garden, and on his field. Thoſe ſinnes that are in the people of God, not raigning with their good liking, but vſurping without their allowance, haue Gods holy eyes bent vpon them indeed, to obſerue and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, not to hate the perſon in whom they be, (for he lookes vpon the perſon through Chriſt; and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, It is no longer they, but ſinne in them:) but to helpe and aſſiſt the perſon againſt them, euen as a good and louing father obſerues the ſpots of his childs face, to make him waſh them off, and his ſcabs or itch, to prouide him a medicine: or as a kind Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lookes on a ſore, to ſearch, and dreſſe, and heale it, not to kill the man for it. As he that mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with an Apple rotten at core, though it look ſoundly on the outſide, caſts it away from him to the dunghill: ſo the Lord, meeting with thoſe in whom ſinne hath dominion, cuts them off, and reiects them vtterly: but as a man meeting with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20394:141"/>an Apple a little ſpecked heere or there, pickes out that is naught, and pares and eates it: ſo the Lord finding men in whom ſinne is dwelling in ſome degree, but is not predominant, pickes out that ſinne, and preſerues them for the vſe of his glory. The Apoſtle ſaith, that God will tread Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan vnder our feet ſhortly; and it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that Satan can neuer be troden vnder foot, if ſinne be not: yea ſinne (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) ſhall not haue dominion ouer your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Can wee deſire a more expreſſe promiſe? The ſame thing we may note in the words of the Prophet: <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone out of your bodies, and giue you an heart of fleſh.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I will deliuer you from all your vncleanneſſes.</hi> We ſee the Lords intention plaine enough, hee will helpe his ſeruants not alone againſt one or two, but againſt all their filthineſſes. So doth the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretell, ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſhall waſh away the filth of the daughter of Sion, and purge the blood of Ieruſalem from the middeſt thereof, with the ſpirit of iudgement, and the ſpirit of burning.</hi> All theſe places put the truth of the poynt out of doubt; and the reaſons of it are as cleere as can be, not onely from the truth and power of God, (who is able abundantly to mortifie our ſinnes, and hath told vs that hee is faithfull and true to forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to cleanſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe) but alſo from two other perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent conſiderations; namely, firſt, that their need requireth it: ſecondly, that it ſtandeth vpon his honour to performe it.</p>

Firſt,<note place="margin">The meanes of this pruning.</note> by what meanes it is effected, and then in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For the firſt, the meanes of purging are of two ſorts, proper,<note place="margin">Some proper.</note> (that are fit to bring forth that effect, of their owne nature) and accidentall, that doe not of their owne nature ſerue for ſo good a purpoſe, but by Gods wiſedome and power are ouer-ruled to the helping forward thereof. The proper meanes are alſo of two kinds, principall, and inſtrumentall. The principall is the bleſſed Spirit of God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> The chiefe, Gods holy Spirit.</note> for that reaſon tearmed a Spirit of burning, becauſe it ſerueth to conſume the corruptions out of our ſoules, as fire doth the droſſe out of the metall. The holy Ghoſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them that beleeue, that they may mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth his efficacie vpon them, in thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ordinances of his that he hath appoynted: &amp; they are then ſaid to crucifie their luſts by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20394:143"/>Spirit, when they doe carefully vſe thoſe ſpirituall weapons, wherewith the holy Ghoſt will neuer faile to cooperate. And if there were not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall operation of the Spirit of Chriſt Ieſus in vs, to heale and helpe vs againſt theſe euils, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould we, by all our owne indeuours, attaine any ſound and thorow purging, but alone a ſlight and ſuperficiall waſhing of the outſide. And it is of great importance for vs to vnderſtand, that the holy Ghoſt is the chiefe worker in this worke, without whom it would neuer ſucceed happily, though we ſhould labour therein with all our might, both that we may be able with a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant thankfulneſſe to acknowledge his care of vs, and loue to vs in ſo great and beneficiall a ſeruice, giuing away the whole praiſe from our ſelues to him; and alſo that wee may bee ready with more humble carefulneſſe to receiue and yeeld our ſelues vp vnto this heauenly worke of his, which can by no meanes be hindred or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but by our not regarding, or not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſoules vnto it. Wee muſt be ſtrong in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the power of his might. His Spirit muſt cloath vs, and come vpon vs; through him we muſt doe valiantly in this ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and he muſt tread downe thoſe luſts that riſe vp againſt vs:</p>
                     <p>But this Spirit worketh in,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, the Word of God.</note> and by an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſtrument, the Word of God, the Law and Goſpell read, preached, heard, meditated vpon, which therfore we tearme an inſtrumentall cauſe of our purging. For when as a Chriſtian man
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20394:143"/>doth exerciſe himſelfe in the Word, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by comming to heare it preached, the Spirit of God doth then worke withall, to make thoſe ſpeeches effectuall, ſtirring vp, and inclining his heart to marke and obſerue the corruptions that are diſcouered vnto him, and ſo to heed the words as to be moued by them. So we reade, that God cleanſed <hi>Dauid</hi> from his impenitent conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in his foule ſinnes, by the wholeſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet. And now are you clean, ſaith our Sauiour anon after the text, by the word that I haue ſpoken vnto you. And as all the exhortations and admonitions of the Word of God doe ſerue to rub off the ruſt from the ſoules of his people: ſo chiefly the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, by vertue of the blood of Chriſt which it offereth and giueth vnto them, is a moſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doctrine. This leaueth in the will of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtified man, ſuch a deepe impreſſion of the bitter death of Chriſt for ſinne, as worketh in it a loathing deteſtation of ſinne, and maketh it to turne it ſelfe away from a thing ſo abominably euill. And this is to crucifie our ſinnes vpon the Croſſe of Chriſt, when the conſideration of the extreme fouleneſſe, and vnvtterable odiouſneſſe of ſinne (which is cleerly manifeſted in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Lord for it) and of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty and brightneſſe of the tender mercy and kindneſſe of God ſhining forth in the ſame paſſion, is ſo ſeriouſly receiued, and doth ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinke into the very heart-root of a man, that it mightily draweth him to ſet downe and inact
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20394:144"/>this concluſion in himſelfe of ſinning no more. In this meaning it is ſaid, that faith purifieth the heart, and that hauing this hope, wee purge our ſelues, as Chriſt is pure: and therefore the Word of God, chiefly the Goſpell, being applyed to the working and increaſing of our faith and hope, becomes a bleſſed inſtrument of our purging. And with theſe proper and naturall meanes,<note place="margin">Some acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall.</note> are vſed alſo certaine accidentall meanes that are made ſo beyond their owne nature. Theſe are chiefly three, Afflictions, Tentations, and falls into ſinne; for euen by poyſon, oftentimes is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cured, and by iron is iron driuen out.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> the ſeruants of God are, and muſt often be chaſtiſed, that they may be whited. Theſe corrections are fit to ſtirre vp ſorrow in thoſe to whom they befall; which ſorrow, by grace, is turned into godly ſorrow, the moſt effectuall corroſiue to eate out the dead fleſh of the ſoule, and ſo the fruit of them is, as the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, the taking away of ſinne. Afflictions make vs to feele the dangerouſneſſe of ſinne: they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie Gods diſlike of wickedneſſe; they manifeſt our owne frailty and baſeneſſe; they conuince vs of the vanity of the world; they pull downe the pride of our ſtomacke, ſo eating out the proud fleſh that growes within vs, that the medicine of the Word may come neere the ſore; they quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs to prayer; they driue vs to examine our ſelues, and inforce vs to conſider of our wayes, that at laſt wee may be able to profeſſe with the Prophet, <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20394:144"/>now I keepe thy righteous iudgements.</hi> There is ſcarce any thing more needfull for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then theſe Fatherly chaſtiſements: they doe breake open the heart, to make a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the Spirit of God to enter in at. They doe plough vp the heart, to make it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſeed of life, the holy doctrine of the Word of God that is ſpoken to them. In proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, many times, the ſoule is dull of hearing, and ſcorneth to bee reproued: It is ſated with outward contents, and takes no delight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the death and blood-ſhedding of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: It taketh pleaſure in vanity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue while to thinke of things ſpirituall and moſt profitable. But afflictions awaken the heart out of the deepe ſleepe of ſecurity: they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte the ſweet meates of the world, and bore the eare, and couer the pride of heart, and make a man, in whom the Spirit of God is, to hearken and attend vnto the motions of the Word, and of the Spirit. The truth is, that afflictions, of themſelues, and in their owne nature, as being fruits of ſinne and euill, are not of this force to purge the heart, but through the wiſedome of him that is able to turne all things to the beſt, and by the working of the Spirit, which taketh aduantage of all ſeaſons and opportunities, they doe become moſt happy inſtruments of our cleanſing: and there is ſcarce any one of all the Saints of God, but may from his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence affirme, that it hath been a great part of his happineſſe, to take and drinke theſe potions from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20394:145"/>the hand of his wiſe and louing Father: for they haue purged out of his ſoule thoſe noyſome, and euill humours, which would otherwiſe haue made him little leſſe then deadly and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſicke.</p>
                     <p>But moreouer,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Satans bitter tentations.</note> the Lord doth make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell himſelfe an vnwilling inſtrument of pruning his ſeruants, by meanes of thoſe fierce tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith hee doth mightily aſſault them. Euen Satans violent buffettings are, by Gods goodneſſe, turned into moſt excellent purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When the diuell is let looſe vpon a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, (as the ſhepheards dog vpon the ſheepe) and with fury and craft ſtriues to bring him to vtter deſpaire, making him beleeue, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pit of hell it ſelfe ſtands gaping before him, ready to ſwallow him vp; or when he doth worke mightily vpon his ſinfull affections, with a kind of exceſſiue violence, haling him to the practice of thoſe deteſtable ſinnes which his ſoule hateth, and making none end to lye at him with vnceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and vehement ſollicitations to commit ſuch and ſuch foule deeds: Oh this cuts, this woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, this vexeth and tormenteth; this ſets them on praying, on weeping, on crying, on bleeding; this doth ſo ſhame him and diſgrace him to himſelfe; this makes him ſo farre out of loue and conceit with himſelfe, and ſo extremely vile and odious in his owne eyes, that he thinkes no name nor vſage bad enough for himſelfe; this alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him, with a bluſhing and confounded face, and with a moſt deiected and a broken ſpirit, to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20394:145"/>runne and cry vnto the Lord his God for helpe and ſtrength. Thus the more Satan ſtriueth to ſtirre corruption, the better it is purged, (for ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it muſt bee, before it can bee purged) and by his tentations being brought to ſee and feele a number of corruptions, which elſe we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſee and feele; wee finde his ſinfull malice, by Gods goodneſſe, made an excellent furtherance to our cleanſing of our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>And not onely ſo,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Their owne ſlips and faults.</note> but in the third and laſt place, our owne ſinnes, faults and ſlips, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtruments of our making cleane from ſinne, euen as a man doth better ſcowre his foule hands, hauing firſt ſmeared them with ſome foule thing that helpeth more to rub off the foulenes that cleaueth faſt vnto the skinne: not that the Children doe, or may at any time of purpoſe commit ſinne to this end, (for it is quite beſides, and againſt the nature of them to bring forth this effect; yea euery ſinne is apt to leaue, as a filthy ſpot behind the committing of it, a greater proneneſſe to commit it then before) but that the Lord doth pleaſe diuers times to giue them ouer to be foyled of their owne ſinfull luſts, that by ſmarting for them, they may bee more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vnder them, and made more carefull to ſee and reſiſt them afterwards. Thus <hi>Peters</hi> fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high Prieſts ſeruants, was a meanes to make him a better, (that is to ſay, a more humble and ſelfe-contemning man) for his whole life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and in a ſence a man may well tearme it, an happy fault for him. And ſo the Prophet <hi>Dauids</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:20394:146"/>hainous and preſumptuous ſinne did excellently prune him, by helping to abate that conceit of himſelfe, which the great proſperity of a rich and flouriſhing kingdome had wrought in him. So wee may ſay of many a Chriſtian man, that hee would neuer haue been good, if ſome of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not been ſtarke naught; and had not the Lord giuen him ouer to the committing of ſuch and ſuch groſſe ſinnes, hee would neuer, to any purpoſe, haue been conuinced of ſinne, and ſo neuer haue been cleanſed of it. Wee thinke not our ſelues ſubiect to all manner of euils, we make no great matter of the lower degrees of ſinne, and ſo grow ſlithy, and faſhionable, and dead in our confeſſions, becauſe we thinke wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth ſpeaking of, to reckon for before the Lord. Hence the Lord is prouoked to giue vs vp vnto our ſelues, that by ſome notable foyle, or ſoyles, we may be made to know what is in vs, and ſo be inforced to ſet about the cleanſing of our ſelues, with much more care and earneſtneſſe then otherwiſe we would haue done. So haue you heard the Lords meanes of purging. Know alſo the manner of doing it:<note place="margin">The manner of weakening ſin: <hi>1.</hi> By ſmall degrees.</note> and that is to bee conceiued of thus: Firſt, he doth it by degrees; ſecondly, by making a mans ſelfe a voluntary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it.</p>
                     <p>The Lord doth at once, in one act within himſelfe, iuſtifie perfectly each beleeuer, fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting him of all ſinne whatſoeuer, through the imputation of Chriſts perfect righteouſnes vnto him, though this bee manifeſted vnto his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20394:146"/>ſoule by degrees, as he doth particularly ſeeke the ſight of it, vpon occaſion of his particular ſinnes: but ſanctification is not wrought in an inſtant; yea, it is effected by little and little, ſome now, ſome then, as a ſore is healed by laying on of one plaiſter to day, which draweth out ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes the wound or vlcer leſſe filthy, and another to morrow, another next day, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it groweth leſſe and leſſe filthy, and leſſe deep, and leſſe wide. For indeed, ſuch an extreme change from the vtter fouleneſſe of corrupted nature, to perfect holineſſe, cannot poſſibly bee wrought in an inſtant, vnleſſe the Lord himſelfe ſhould pleaſe euen immediately, and more then miraculouſly to worke it, which it ſeemeth not good vnto him to doe. Hence it is, that hauing ordained to purge vs by meanes, (and namely thoſe that you heard of before) hee performeth it in ſuch manner as ſorteth to the nature of the meanes; alone this is to bee noted, that ſtill the change of Gods ſeruants from ſinne to holineſſe, is made more apparant, by making the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more felt, as they be more healed, contrary to that which falleth out in bodily ſores. For if a mans hand bee wounded, the neerer it is to healing, the leſſe paine he feeles with it, and the leſſe troubleſome it is to him: but if the ſoule bee wounded with any corruption; for example, with pride, or worldlineſſe, or the like, the more it is cleanſed from him, and the leſſer degrees of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in him, the more troubleſome and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue will thoſe remnants proue vnto his ſoule, ſo
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20394:147"/>that the little pride and worldlineſſe that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth behind vnhealed, will vex him more then the greater quantity of thoſe vices did when they were leſſe healed. Euermore ſinnes prooue moſt tedious and cumberſome, when a man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a greater perfection of ſtrength againſt them. For the ſoule, the more holy it is, the more it hateth vnholineſſe, and the more ſenſible it muſt needs be of the thing that it more hateth. A man in his vtter vnregeneracy is dead in ſinne, ſo that he doth not feele it at all to bee burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto him; but when grace comes in ſmall degrees, it begins to be felt, and the more mighty grace growes, the more it is felt, till at laſt, in that meaſure of perfection that is in this life attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the ſmalleſt imperfections are more diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull, and breed more anguiſh, then at firſt the greateſt did. Hell, and death, and the puniſhment of ſinne is more bitter to Gods ſeruants in their weaker eſtate; but ſinnes, and diſorders, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are moſt bitter, as they grow moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in ſpirituall ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>But as this helpe againſt ſinne doth come by ſmall degrees,<note place="margin">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20394:147"/>make a Chriſtian man good, as it were, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of his heart, and whether he will or no, but doth worke in him a deſire of goodneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth his will to wiſh and purſue it, and ſtirreth vp in him a deteſtation of ſinne, and turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his will from it, and ſo is he a fellow-worker with God to his owne cleanſing, when the Lord hath once breathed the breath of a new life in him. By his owne crying, ſtriuing, labouring, praying, reſoluing, reſiſting, oppoſing, hee gets the victory againſt his ſinnes, and becomes more then a conquerour. The Lord will not beate downe the ſinnes of his people, as ſometimes he did the Canaanites with haileſtones, without any helpe of their owne, that they ſhould, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting, come after alone to the ſpoyle: but they muſt fight againſt their fleſhly luſts, and muſt worke with God, as it is ſaid that <hi>Ionathan</hi> did, and ſo God doth ſubdue their enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, by working in them a reſolution, care and indeuour to vanquiſh them, and ſtirring them vp to meditate, pray, cry, and vſe the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall weapons of this holy warfare. And thus doth the Lord purge the branches in this Vine.</p>
                     <p>Now hauing ſufficiently proued and cleered the poynt, we muſt make ſome vſe of it.</p>

The Lord hath come neere them in his Word, it hath not purged them; he hath come neere them in afflictions, and loe, their droſſe will not bee melted from them: nay, their ſinnes ſeeme to waxe ſtronger and ſtronger, and their corruptions grow euery day more heady and violent then other, and yet they ſee not this impairing of their ſoules, with griefe and ſhame of heart, but reſt themſelues well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in ſo miſerable an eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, there are not a few people inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnder the roofe of Gods Houſe the Church, with whom it fareth directly in this manner that I haue deſcribed, to whom wee haue a diſmall tidings to deliuer, and that is this; that they bee
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20394:148"/>not fruitfull branches in Chriſt, becauſe they want that which our Sauiour Chriſt affirmes, that euery true branch obtaineth. Whatſoeuer perſon he is, that liueth a reputed member of the Church, frequenteth the ordinances of God, meeteth with diuers ſorrowes and calamities, and thus hath a long while continued, and yet ſeeth no more ſinne in himſelfe then before, is no more troubled at his ſinne then at firſt, gets no more power againſt his ſinne then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but goes along ſtill in a kind of ſettled ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility of liuing to men-ward, and there reſteth himſelfe, neither perceiuing, nor greatly caring to perceiue any healing of priuie pride, of ſecret guile, of deadneſſe and coldneſſe of ſpirit, of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, of the loue of earthly things, of wrath, of reuengefulneſſe, of other naughty luſts of his euill heart: let this man come hither, and out of this text of Scripture truly interpreted, truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, collect and gather a moſt fearefull conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt his owne ſoule, in this wiſe: Euery fruitfull branch in the Vine, that is, euery true member of Chriſt, euery ſound-hearted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is purged, that is, healed and cleanſed of the ſinfulneſſe and corruptions of his heart and life: but I, though I haue beene trained vp in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Church, and inioyed all Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and haue alſo taſted of ſome ſowreneſſe too in my dayes, which ſhould haue helped to my reformation, haue found no purging nor clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, am no whit helped againſt my ſinnes of all ſorts; wherefore I am not a fruitfull branch, I am
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20394:149"/>not a true member of Chriſt, I am no ſound-hearted Chriſtian. Is not this a ſound, certaine, and infallible concluſion, that is ſo directly, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly inferred out of the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? And how then can you flatter your ſelues in vaine, O all yee that are not cleanſed of your iniquities? How can you make your ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you are good Chriſtians? how can you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to your ſelues remiſſion of ſinnes and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all other priuiledges of true Chriſtians, and inioy a kind of falſe content in a falſe hope of finding fauour with God? Doubtleſſe it is true that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a generation that are cleane in their owne eyes, and yet are not purged from their filthineſſe.</hi> Theſe perſons that haue no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, feele no need of pruning, and are moſt apt to brag of cleanneſſe, by how much they are more vnclenſed. But miſerable is that man, whoſe beſt remedy againſt miſery is this, that he will not ſee it. I pray you therefore, if you bee branches deſtitute of pruning, that you would not ſuffer your ſelfe-loue to hinder you from taking notice of your vncleanſedneſſe, nor from a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of your miſery following thence, in that it is moſt certainly concluded from this Scripture, that you be but Hypocrites at the beſt. And yet let not my weak Chriſtian miſconceiue this poynt to his owne needleſſe and cauſeleſſe vexation, concluding againſt himſelfe, that if that be no true branch which wanteth pruning, then himſelfe is doubtleſſe in an hard caſe: for alacke, diuers of his corruptions are ſo far from being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20394:149"/>purged from him, that they doe rather gather ſtrength, and preuaile more and more within him. For doubtleſſe it may befall euen a true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified man,<note place="margin">Some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corruption may grow more ſtrong in a true Chriſtian:</note> to haue ſome ſinnes more violent and headſtrong in him, after that hee hath a long time continued in the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, then they were at the firſt, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of his heart in ſome kind may diſcouer themſelues by much and often breaking foorth, which informer time he was better able to keep, as wee know it by record of holy writ, to haue falne out to <hi>Dauid, Aſa,</hi> and other of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children.</p>
                     <p>Farre be it therefore from the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to conclude he hath no ſoundneſſe, becauſe hee findes ſome one or other diſorder rather grow more mighty in him. This may be, and yet he inioy the benefit of pruning, which God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth to all true branches: if hee ſee and feele the working of this corruption whatſoeuer, if he lament it, if he continue to ſtriue againſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vile in his owne eyes becauſe of it, this ſin doth not rule in him; and this is the very pruning promiſed, which ſhall at length ſo far preuaile, till that he himſelfe doe perceiue a very ſenſible conqueſt ouer this luſt.</p>
                     <p>So long then as ſinnes in generall doe decay,<note place="margin">But ſinne in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and that ſinne is ſeene and lamented, and becomes matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note> and that one ſinne that lifteth vp it ſelfe more then before, is ſeene, lamented, reſiſted, a man may, and muſt account himſelfe a liuing branch. But the men whom I condemned as Hypocrites and dry branches, are thoſe, which ſatisfying
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20394:150"/>themſelues in a formall performance of outward exerciſes of piety, are quite deſtitute of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of them, for the ſubduing of ſinne, ſo that further then credit and naturall reſpects do ſway with them, they follow any ſinfull luſt of their hearts, and yet feele not their miſery in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but applaud themſelues in their eſtate, all the while that they are free from ſuch groſſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices as would caſt them into reproch and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie amongſt men. A man profeſſing Religion, and being thus vncleanſed of his filthineſſe, is ſure no better then a withering branch, which yet theſe kind of men will ſcarce euer be made to confeſſe. Wherefore leauing them, wee will make a ſecond vſe of the poynt, to comfort all Gods Saints, that if they will not deny the good worke of Gods grace in them, muſt needs confeſſe, that the Lord hath mercifully vouchſafed to prune them.</p>

                     <p>I confeſſe that there is a kinde of cleanſing,<note place="margin">A kind of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing may befall an vnſanctified man.</note> which is not from Gods ſanctifying Spirit, ſuch as hath bin found euen in Heathen men, without the Church, and without Chriſt. This is ſuch a leauing of ſome one or other outward groſſe ſin as ariſeth from age or miſery, or other like natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſes: the heart, in the generall diſpoſition, ſtill remaining the ſame; for a mans owne rod may ſo beate him, as the common Prouerbe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that he may be forced from thoſe euill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices which once he followed: as the vnthrifty man, after he hath waſted his eſtate almoſt to the bottome, and perceiueth penury comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, may ſo farre returne to himſelfe, as to ceaſe to bee riotous; and the theeſe that hath beene frighted once or twice with the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row eſcape of hanging, may ceaſe to giue himſelfe ouer to theeuery; and the man whoſe age and bodily decay doth not ſerue the turne to performe his vnchaſte pleaſures, may ceaſe to follow harlots; and ſo in other like parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. This departing from a few outward acts of euill, the heart remaining ſtill impoyſoned with the wonted inward diſorders, or other as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20394:151"/>bad, is not the cleanſing which the Lord doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the true branches of the Vine, neither may any man intitle himſelfe to the comfort wee haue in hand, from ſuch a maimed kind of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But if any man doe finde himſelfe clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſoule from the loue and liking of all known euils proportionably, that what by the Word, what by afflictions, or ſuch like meanes, hee hath been made to take notice of more corruptions in himſelfe, then euer before he thought to haue beene there, and ſeeing the ſame, to deteſt them, and abhorre himſelfe for them before God, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſtrength and power to reforme them; and by crauing ſtrength, hath obtained at Gods hands, though not a totall releaſe from theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, yet a great decay of them, and a farre greater ability to leaue them, then in former time: Let theſe men reioyce in the liuing God, and take this worke of his Spirit in them, for an aſſured proofe of their being truly ingraffed into the body of Chriſt. Thoſe that doe mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit, they ſhall liue; thoſe that are crucified together with Chriſt, ſhall raigne with him, and hauing beene made conformable to his death, ſhall alſo be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his glory. Wherefore as <hi>Samſon</hi> fed on the honey which he found in the carkaſe of the Lion that hee had ſlaine; ſo let all Gods people feede vpon the comfort which growes vnto them from the ſinnes that they haue ouercome. For doubtleſſe, nothing is more auailable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the worke of mortification, then with ioy
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20394:151"/>to looke vpon the good beginnings thereof, and comfortably to behold the dying of ſinne, that a man may ſay to himſelfe, Loe now, mine inward and ſpirituall enemies are ſmitten downe before me, and become like foes that are put to flight, and many of them ſlaine in the chaſe. When a man lookes into himſelfe, and comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with himſelfe, findes, that by Gods grace, ſuch and ſuch euils doe leſſe preuaile within him then they were wont; yea, that now the leaſt motions of them are more hatefull to him, then formerly ſome groſſe outward faultings therein; and that the inclinations of that kind which hee feeleth in himſelfe, are either fewer, or weaker, or both, that hee ſooner ſpyeth, more heartily and inwardly lamenteth and condemneth, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently reſiſteth and oppoſeth them, at leaſt is much more humbled and abaſed to himſelfe by meanes of them, then formerly: This is to be pruned, and this is a true ſigne of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly branch in the true Vine Chriſt Ieſus. Neither let the people of God take leſſe comfort in this pruning, becauſe it is not totall, nor all at once; but if they finde it to goe forward, though ſlowly and by ſmall degrees, and to haue been attained by their ſpirituall induſtry in the vſe of ſpirituall meanes: now let them clap their hands and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in God, ſaying, <hi>Through God I haue done va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, for he hath troden downe mine enemies that roſe vp againſt me.</hi> We muſt not ſuffer our ſelues to be ſo much vexed with the remainders of our corruptions, as to depriue the Lord of the glory,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20394:152"/>and our owne ſoules of the comfort which wee might reape from the beginning of their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: but muſt make our ſelues exceeding glad of this their firſt falling before vs, that ſo we may more aſſuredly conclude as they doe concerning <hi>Haman,</hi> when he began to fall before <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that he ſhould not preuaile, but ſhould ſurely fall quite before him. When wee obſerue the fruits of our faith, as meanes to confirme our faith, and the good workes of Gods grace, as arguments to aſſure vs that wee are receiued into the ſtate of grace; this is an excellent meanes to make theſe fruits of faith, and workes of grace to grow ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger in vs. An heart cheered vp in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and acknowledging the goodneſſe of God, that hath in ſome meaſure bleſſed his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour againſt ſinne, ſhall bee greatly furthered in this ſpirituall combate. It animates ſouldiers to fight: when as <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſpeaketh concerning <hi>Sauls</hi> ſouldiers, they eate the ſpoyle of their enemies: but when they doe keepe themſelues faſting, as it were, like as <hi>Saul</hi> did his ſouldiers, pretending thereby to make them more eager in following the chaſe; this makes them to be faint and weary, and ſo doth very much hinder the ſlaughter of the foe. Wherefore, ye Chriſtian ſouldiers, that haue fought manfully vnder Chriſt your Lord, with the weapons of the Word and Prayer, and the like, and haue found that your holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and prayers haue diminiſhed the force of your corruptions, in ſome good meaſure eate you the ſpoyle of your ſpirituall enemies; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

In truth, we want much of that mortification which we might attaine, if out of this confidence we would put forth our ſelues to the vtmoſt.

                     <p>But now know thou that theſe concluſions are falſe. I tell thee the quite contrary in the name of the Lord: It ſhall not be in vaine to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne: the husbandman will prune the branches; and ſhall not hee bee able to bring his workes to paſſe according to his promiſe? Tell me from thine owne feeling: doe not theſe ſins vexe thee more and more, and art thou not more and more angry and diſcontented againſt thy ſelfe for them, and more and more out of loue with thy ſelfe becauſe of them? if ſo, as ſure thou canſt not deny but it is ſo, then all is ſafe; this is to be in pruning, now the ſinne is dying: onely doe thou make vſe of Gods words to <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Canaanites: Faint not, nor bee diſcouraged, but take to thy ſelfe a valiant ſpirit,

Our want of being ſufficiently purged, doth come from want of ſufficient indeuours to purge our ſelues; and this want ſpringeth from a want of faithful aſſurance of Gods aſſiſtance, and good ſucceſſe in our indeuours. But now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you all that bee members of Chriſt, ſet in earneſtly and with a good courage, and you ſhall vanquiſh them, you ſhall more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt them, till at laſt you haue quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, in the ouercomming of the laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which is death.

The Lord is preſent with thy prayers, to make them effectuall for the killing of thy luſts.

And thus, alacke, it is with many a man. Time was, when they were frequent in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word of God, and could not bee kept from it by any meanes: now their hunger after it is turned into fulneſſe, and the leaſt occaſion that is, will detaine them from it; yea, rather then faile, they will quarrell with the Miniſter, (either for ſome poynt of doctrine which hee teacheth contrary to their minds, or for ſome faultineſſe in the manner of teaching, or for ſome miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of life, or for ſome thing or other, againſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20394:157"/>which they can alleage any probable ſhew of quarrell) rather then that they will not ſeeme to themſelues to haue cauſe of not caring to come to heare. They were wont to reade much, and pray often, and take time to meditate vpon thoſe things which they had heard; but now all theſe things are either quite laid aſide, or very ſeldome performed: once they were abundant in workes of mercy, now they are ſcant and ſparing: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they were liuely in their ſeruices, now lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſſe then dead: and ſo it is with them, that any man which hath occaſion of conuerſing with them, may plainly perceiue them to be changed from better to worſe. O, this is a lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, hauing its originall in the ouergrowth of voluptuouſneſſe, worldlineſſe, pride, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like carnall affection, and ſhall haue its iſſue either in ſome grieuous ſinne, or heauy calamity, or both, euen though they bee Gods children. I dare not ſay, brethren, that it may not befall a true Chriſtian, thus to fade for a ſeaſon, (and yet the withering of the blade is a ſore ſigne of a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ground:) But this I dare ſay, that vnleſſe they doe ſeaſonably recouer themſelues, and returne to their former goodneſſe, or more, the Lord will ſurely chaſtiſe them in grieuous manner, ſending ſome or other heauy calamity vpon them, either inward or outward; or if hee doe not ſo fetch them home againe, this decay of ſeeming gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is in truth the firſt degree of the cutting off of Hypocrites. So long as a man continues thus in the wane, hee can inioy no comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20394:157"/>of himſelfe, nor can other men maintaine any full perſwaſion of him that hee was vpright, but he muſt needs be ſubiect to the miſery of being alwayes queſtioned both in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, and in the account of his owne heart, for matter of his intireneſſe and truth; and ſo though it were raſhneſſe to ſay, that all they are diſſemblers that fare in this manner; (for a man may recouer himſelfe, as I ſhewed aboue,) yet this may one ſafely ſay of ſuch, that they are ſo like to diſſemblers, as neither others, nor ſcarce themſelues can diſtinguiſh them from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Indeed there is one note of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the winter of a true branch, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a dead, which we will anon ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: but yet this note of difference will afford but a ſmall quantity of comfort to them with whom it is winter. Let that man therefore, whoſe ſoule is guilty of ſuch decreaſe in piety, ſee, and take notice of its vnhappineſſe. Wofull is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of him, that if he be not an Hypocrite, yet is now become ſo neere in likeneſſe to that euill brood, as his owne heart will hardly bee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take him for better. I will ſhew you a true note of diſtinction betwixt a liuing branch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the decayes that it may ſuffer, and a dead branch thus beginning to be cut off from the Vine, that wee may not leaue the vpright hearted deſtitute of that comfort which appertaineth vnto him, euen though he be at his worſt that euer hee can. The falſe hearted man doth likely pleaſe himſelfe in his growing backward, conceiting that he was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20394:158"/>too forward before, but is now growne ſober, and ſtayed, and wiſe; though indeed, what he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, was no more then he ought to haue done, and ſo he ſatisfieth, yea and magnifyeth himſelfe in his lamentable decayes. But the true Chriſtian is exceeding weary of his going downe the wind for his ſoule. It is a clog to his ſoule to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe worſe then he was; yea, if hee ſeeme to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but to ſtand at a ſtay, it is an anguiſh vnto him, and his life is tedious, when hee findes not that life of Religion and goodneſſe in himſelfe that once he felt. Now then, if your decayes bee by you thus felt and bewailed, if they be an heauy load and burthen to you, very troubleſome and diſcontentfull to your minds, you may haue bin true-hearted, for all theſe faintings and ſwoones, and yet your caſe is much to be pityed: for the Lord muſt be at paines to prune you, that you may bring forth more fruit, becauſe it is nothing elſe (as I ſaid before) but the ouer-growing of ſome corrupt luſt that hath brought you to this euill paſſe. But if any amongſt you bee ſo falne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his former ſhewes or beginnings of piety, that he be well apayd with this his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and take it for his glory, that hee is now growne luke-warme, ſo boaſting in his ſhame; let that man know, that hee was but an hypocrite before, and that this is a beginning of his cutting off from the Vine; yea and that his eſtate is not recouerable, without exceeding much labour and paines. Take notice therefore, I intreat euery ſoule amongſt you, whether it bee
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20394:158"/>decayed, and in what manner it ſtands affected vnder theſe decayes, that you may accordingly cenſure your ſelues, and fruitfully accept this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the Word. For, giue me leaue a little to reaſon with you on Gods behalfe: What vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, what niggardize, what churliſhneſſe haue you found in the God of heauen now alate, that you ſhoul bee leſſe zealous and carefull in doing him ſeruice, then you were formerly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed? Is God grown worſe to you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are ſo changed towards him? Is the Word of God leſſe mighty to bring you to ſaluation? Is prayer leſſe effectuall to draw good things from heauen? Are holy meditations leſſe comfortable to the ſoule? Are the exerciſes of repeutance, and of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row leſſe gainfull, that you doe now beſtow leſſe time and care in theſe duties, then in former ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? or is the feare and loue of God, humility, faith, mercy, bounty, zeale, leſſe pleaſing to God, leſſe beautifull, leſſe ſweet, leſſe profitable in it ſelfe and to the poſſeſſours, then once it was, that you haue now ſuffred your ſelues to be leſſe ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? O conſider how extremely you do diſhonour God and goodneſſe, and indamage your ſelues, and diſcourage others by this your going backe in the way of goodneſſe. Conſider how wrongfull it is to the whole Church, and how euery way exceeding ſcandalous, if your decayes be publike, that you are waxen leſſe good then you were. Lay theſe things to heart, and put not off a reproofe lightly. Conſider with your ſelues what corruption it is, that as a bad
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20394:159"/>humour becomming exceſſiue, hath brought your ſoules into this conſumption. Lament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God your ſhamefull folly, in bringing the eſtate of your ſoules behinde, and ceaſe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, bewailing, and praying, till you find your ſelues quickened and reſtored. Aſſure your ſelues, that if you haue been any other then arrant Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and dry branches, who being cut off, are caſt out and wither, till they bee gathered vp to burne; you muſt ſometime or other take the paines of thus reſtoring your ſelues to your anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fruitfulneſſe. Were it not as good accept of this admonition, as tarry longer, and make the worke harder by delayes? If words will not bring you to a ſence of your miſery, in that your ſoules are ſo ill affected, you ſhall compell the Lord to become ſeuere in chaſtiſements; for much rather had he to make you ſmart, then to ſee you periſh. See, ſee the ſickneſſe of thy ſoule, which hath made thee to grow weake and feeble in all inward graces and holy duties, and ſuffer not thy ſelfe to be ſo hardened, that the hearing of theſe words ſhould bee in vaine vnto thee. Shew thy ſelfe not to haue been a diſſembler in thy former forwardnes, by ſuffering thy ſelfe to be reſtored to it againe by this exhortation. Make it appeare, that all was not falſe which did afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſeeme to be in thee, by recouering thy firſt eſtate, and doing thy firſt workes. O now yeeld to the call of the liuing God, and let theſe words of his in his own ordinance, be as a good reſtoratiue to thy ſick ſoule, to make it whole &amp; ſtrong again.</p>

Be not therefore ſatisfied with what you haue already gotten, but ſtriue to get more. Make your ſelues euen vnſatiably co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous after grace: account your ſelues neuer to haue enough, but for this matter: imitate the Horſe-leach, and the graue, and be alwayes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Giue, giue; for no grace is further ſound, then it is ioyned with an hungring after more. O then, trauell forward in the paths of righteouſnes daily. Labour to be each weeke more holy, more heauenly minded, more patient, more temperate, more contentfull, more prayerfull, more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and affectionate in holy cogitations, and to doe all good things more ſincerely, and more heartily, with a more particular and actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of Gods glory in each of them, and with a more feeling attractiue of loue inducing you to them. Grow, I ſay, continually, either big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or better, or both. Let theſe words put wings
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20394:160"/>to your ſoules, and let this exhortation, as it were a good gale of wind to a ſhip, carry you more ſwiftly towards the hauen of perfection.

Let there bee no going backe in any hand, no flying, no reuolting. By going backe, you ſhall as much as proclaime to all the world, that you account Gods ſeruice an ill ſeruice, and his worke an vnprofitable worke, not worth the while to imploy your ſelues in it. By going backe, you ſhould giue occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to others, and lay vp matter of griefe and ſhame for your ſelues. Offer not God this iniury, doe not ſuch hurt to your ſelues and to your brethren. But as the God of heauen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth his mercies daily, and inlargeth his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo doe you daily renew your obedience, and let your graces be ſtill on the thriuing hand. But that my words may not bee fruitleſſe in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you to grow, let me alſo declare vnto you

And yeelding a man to liue with a ſpirituall life in Chriſt, the meanes of growth to his ſoule, may not vnfitly be reſembled to thoſe that concerne his body. The body will grow, if it be of a good conſtitution, and haue a good ſtomacke, good diet, and good digeſtion; ſo will the ſoule alſo: and therefore wee will ſpeake a word or two of each of theſe.</p>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20394:161"/>the ſoule: and if this conſtitution be not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by a diligent watching ouer the mouing and working of our mindes, and a daily ſtriuing to pull them from things below, and ſet them on things aboue, there is no poſſibility of growing: but if this conſtitution bee carefully preſerued, the meanes following will infallibly procure a proceeding in all the fruits of good liuing.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond thing required,<note place="margin">

If I compare my ſelfe with thoſe of Gods Saints, whoſe examples are commended in Scripture for mine imitation, I come ſo ſhort of them, that it may almoſt bee a queſtion, whether I haue any goodneſſe or none at all. What a little meekneſſe haue I, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>Moſes?</hi> what a little zeale of Gods glory, in compariſon of <hi>Dauid?</hi> what little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare affliction for Chriſts ſake, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>Paul?</hi> what little faith in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in compariſon of their faiths that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrewes commendeth to mee? O how farre did <hi>Iob</hi> ſurpaſſe mee in patience, in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20394:161"/>bounty, in religiouſneſſe, in the feare of God? How farre did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> goe beyond me in loue to the Church and people of God, and zealous deſire of promoting the worſhip of God? So weigh thy ſelfe in the ballance againſt the godly men which are famous in holy Writ, and ſeeing how much thou wanteſt of what they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, (and yet that which they had, commeth farre ſhorter of what they ſhould haue had, then what thou haſt, doth come ſhort of what they had) then moue thy deſire to an increaſe, and thinke thus, Ah that I could get at leaſt a little more grace! Ah that my graine of faith were made two graines! Ah that my one talent were made two talents, my two fiue! What might I doe to get more grace? what courſe might I take to fil vp that which is wanting to my faith, patience, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, confidence, and other like vertues? To whet a mans appetite in this manner, and to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his deſires towards vertues, doth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helpe to make him capable of them, and is, as one may terme it, a great inducement to the Lord, to beſtow more vpon him; for the Lord, as once <hi>Iob,</hi> doth loue to feed the hungry, and to giue drinke vnto them that thirſt. But ſome man may haply demand, How ſhall one get his ſoule a good ſtomacke? To this queſtion I anſwere, that the bodily appetite is ſtirred vp by two things, ſharpe ſawce, and due exerciſe;<note place="margin">The way to get a good appetite. <hi>1.</hi> Sharpe ſawce, that is, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of godly ſorrow for ſinnes paſt.</note> and ſo is the appetite of the ſoule after grace.</p>
                     <p>Now the ſawce of the ſoule, in which by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping its morſels, it may prouoke its deſires after
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20394:162"/>holineſſe and vertue, is the renewing of ſorrow for ſinnes paſt, and preſent. And when a good man findeth himſelfe to grow dul in holy deſires, if he will ſet a little time apart, to call himſelfe to account for his ſinnes paſt, and to conſider the greatneſſe and multitude of them, the heauy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment he hath deſerued, and Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for them, the exceeding great diſhonour he hath done to God by them, and how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vile and baſe they haue made him; and heerehence to inforce himſelfe to be ſad and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, and to ſigh and grone for theſe offences of his; This will quicken his ſpirituall deſires, this will reuiue and ſtirre vp his longings, and make him earneſtly couetous after grace.</p>
                     <p>But exerciſe is needfull to get a ſtomacke;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Exerciſe, that is, a ſetting our ſelues to practiſe what we learne.</note> and the ſoules exerciſe is to ſet it ſelfe on worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout good duties, to ſtirre vp frequent acts of vertue within it ſelfe, often bending his heart in loue to God-ward, melting it in compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the afflicted, inlarging it in congratulation to thoſe of Gods Saints that are in good eſtate, and ſo in other vertues, eſpecially when we haue been taught any good worke in the Word, to watch the next opportunity of doing that duty, and to ſet our ſelues, for ſome good ſpace of time together, principally to looke to the practice of ſome principall vertue, the loue and feare of God, ioy in the holy Ghoſt, godly ſorrow, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and the like. This addreſſing ones ſelfe to the practice of good duties, will beget a deſire of grace. And this is the ſecond thing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20394:162"/>neceſſary to cauſe an increaſe of grace.</p>
                     <p>The third is, good food.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>3.</hi> Good food will make one grow, and Chriſt is our food, and other things, ſo farre as they leade to Chriſt.</note> And the food of our ſoules is Chriſt Ieſus, offered vnto vs, in the Word, and in the Sacraments, and in ſome ſort alſo in the workes of God, that wee may feede vpon him, and grow ſtrong in him, and in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his might. Chriſt Ieſus is the bread of life; when by the Word and Sacraments, and workes of God, wee are moued and drawne to goe out of our ſelues, to reſt, cleaue, ſtay vpon him for grace, life, ſaluation, ſtrength, &amp; all good things, then we doe euen fill our ſoules with him, and then we are ſure to waxe ſtrong. In all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God we muſt bee directed to Chriſt, neither can they doe vs any good, further then they guide vs to Chriſt, and to a depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>If you remaine in me,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour by and by after, <hi>you ſhall bring forth much fruit.</hi> Lo our food. In the Word, and in each part of it, we muſt ſeeke Chriſt; in the Sacraments wee muſt ſeeke Chriſt. All the workes of Gods hand muſt leade vs vnto Chriſt; I meane, to looke to him for grace, to ſtay vpon him for all good things: when the Word teacheth any good thing, it muſt cauſe vs to reſt on the Lord Ieſus for ſtrength to performe it; when it diſcouereth any ſinne, it muſt driue vs to Chriſt for power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, and fauour to pardon it; when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth good, it muſt ſtill draw vs to the ſame Chriſt, in him to obtaine the promiſes; when it threatens euill, it muſt driue vs to Chriſt, that we may truſt by him to eſcape it. So the Sacraments
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20394:163"/>muſt conduct vs to Chriſt, and ſettle our ſoules in aſſurance of attaining all good things in him. When we receiue bleſſings of any kind at Gods hand, they muſt make vs taſte the ſweetneſſe of his loue in Chriſt; when we feele the ſharpeneſſe of his chaſtening hand, it muſt ſpurre vs forward to a more earneſt ſeeking of our reconciliation with him in Chriſt: and thus all that God doth to vs, and all his ordinances that wee inioy, by leading vs vnto the true Bread of life, ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily confirme and ſtrengthen vs in the inner Man. For if wee abide in Chriſt, and Chriſts Word in vs, then ſhall we be ſurely fruitfull.</p>
                     <p>The laſt thing to helpe growth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>4.</hi> Good dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is needfull to growth: and our digeſting, is ſerious pondering and meditating of good things.</note> is good dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: when the bodily food is conueyed into the ſtomacke, and there concocted by the natiue heate, then it becomes fit to be diſperſed abroad to the ſtrengthening of euery limme and ioynt: ſo the Word of God, the Commandements, the promiſes, the threats, and the workes of God, both of mercy and iuſtice, muſt be muſed, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, pondered vpon. A man muſt ſet himſelfe ſeriouſly to conſider how true thoſe promiſes be, and how much they concerne him, and ſo ſettle his heart more and more in the imbracing of them. He muſt tel himſelfe how holy thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements be, how much he is bound to obey them, and ſo euen inforce his heart to a reſolued purpoſe of following the direction of them. A light perfunctory hearing and ſpeaking of the diuine truths, of the Word, concerning God, Chriſt, our ſelues, and our duty, and the like, will
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20394:163"/>affoord little or no ſtrength; but if a man will beſtow paines and time to conſider of theſe things ſeriouſly, and to make his thoughts dwell vpon them ſome good while together, ſtriuing to beate them into his heart, and to frame his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions accordingly; this would be as ſure a means of ſtrength vnto his ſoule, as good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome concoction of good food vnto his body.</p>
                     <p>And thus, my brethren, ſo many of you as are liuing and true branches in Chriſt, may ſee what is required of you, that you may bring forth more fruit in him. Lay to heart that which you formerly heard, conſider the profit, poſſibility, neceſſity of this growth, and be not a ſluggard for thy ſoule. Thou ſeeſt how the worldly-minded man doth toyle his head and body, in ſeeking to grow in riches: thou ſeeſt how the ambitious man beſtirres himſelfe, in getting more prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: thou ſeeſt with what an eager and vnſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable greedineſſe, the voluptuous man doth purſue his pleaſures: why ſhouldeſt not thou, that art a Chriſtian, and a ſpirituall man, with at leaſt ſome meaſure of the like diligence, addreſſe thy ſelfe to thriue in the goods of the ſoule, to get an higher degree of this beſt promotion, and to inioy more and more of theſe moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of all pleaſures? No profit is ſo profitable, no honour ſo honourable, no pleaſure ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurefull, as to bee fruitfull in good workes, and to abound more and more in the vertues of the inward man, and all the good effects thereof. Wherefore againe and againe bee intreated to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20394:164"/>make it the principall ſcope of your liues, to waxe more and more godly, and righteous in life.</p>

O well are they: growth is a moſt ſure ſigne of life: a rotten branch growes not, a rotten arme growes not. Whoſoeuer therefore perceiueth that his care of liuing godlily in Chriſt Ieſus increaſeth, that he is more and more deſirous to obey God, and that his workes are better at laſt, then at firſt, bleſſed be he of the Lord: let him receiue this happy comfort from the mouth of God, and conclude himſelfe infallibly to bee a liuing branch, a ſound-hearted Chriſtian. Indeed the people of God, to whom this conſolation doth moſt duly appertaine, are not euer forward for the moſt part to imbrace the ſame: yea, they are ready to depriue themſelues of it by diuerſity of obiections, and by name thus you ſhall haue them ſpeaking againſt themſelues: Alas, is there not a growth of Hypocrites, as well as of the true-hearted? Doth not the blade ſpring vp as well in the ſtony, and in the thorny ground, as in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20394:164"/>the good ground? And how can I aſſure my ſelfe, but that this growth of mine is ſuch, as may befall a diſſembler? I anſwere, It muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that the man of a guilefull ſpirit, the cloſe Hypocrite hath his fulneſſe, his period, his ſtate, to which he may come, and to which, till he haue reached, he ſeemeth both to himſelfe and others, to grow.</p>
                     <p>But the difference is manifeſt and expreſſe.<note place="margin">The difference betwixt the growth of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and the true-hearted.</note> The Hypocrites growing in the ſhewes of goodneſſe, cauſeth him alſo to grow in conceit of himſelfe; he thinkes better of himſelfe, and much applaudeth his owne proceedings: but the godly man groweth in a meane conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and as he waxeth better and better, ſo doth more &amp; more condemne himſelfe, that he is not better then he is. He ſees things to be better with him then they were; but alas, he ſees them alſo to be ſo farre ſhort of what they ſhould be, that hee is euen grieued with himſelfe, to thinke of his wants and defects. The true godly man growes in humility, as in other graces; but the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite growes in conceitedneſſe, and high eſteeme of himſelfe. When a man prayes, but is much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with diſlike of himſelfe, becauſe hee prayes no better; meditates, but blames himſelfe, becauſe his meditations are ſo ſhattered and diſtracted; is merciful, but is angry againſt himſelfe, becauſe he is not more mercifull: this mans growth is a ſound, perfect, and ſincere growth; but when hee performeth theſe duties ſo, that hee is good in his owne eyes, becauſe of the performance of them;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20394:165"/>this is but a ſhooting vp of a blade, that after will wither and come to nothing. The fruitful branch, in his fruitfulneſſe ſees ſo many wants, that hee is humbled thereby, the vnfruitfull branch is ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with his ſhewes of fruitfulneſſe, that he ſtill magnifieth himſelfe, and deſpiſeth others, being increaſed in pride, by the increaſe of thoſe things that ſeeme good in him. It is a moſt manifeſt thing in all true godly men, that when all men elſe doe perceiue them to grow, and commend them for it, they doe moſt complaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues for want of growth; for they are ſo ſtil carryed onward to that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they forget that that is behind: but the diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler ſo looketh behinde him, and forgetteth what is before, that he ſtands admiring himſelfe for that which he hath already done, and thinkes hee is better then this man, and that man, and compareth and preferreth himſelfe before others. Againe, the godly man doth commend others that are better then himſelfe, and beholds their goodneſſe with great liking and approbation, being diſcontented with himſelfe that hee is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped by them: but the Hypocrite is moued with enuy and indignation againſt thoſe that goe beyond him, and will haue ſome quarrell to picke againſt their (as hee counteth it) ouer-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe. The godly man ſaith ſtill, he is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruant; the Hypocrite brags of his ſeruice, and glories in himſelfe that hee is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in wealth. Now then, conſider if thy growth in goodneſſe be accompanyed with a growth in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20394:165"/>humility, and in an abaſing of thy ſelfe, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king better of others, then of thy ſelfe; or if it be ioyned with conceit of thy ſelfe, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thy ſelfe aboue others, and enuy againſt them that ſeeme to obſcure thy praiſes: and if it be with thee in the former manner, thou groweſt indeed, and muſt inioy comfort; if in the latter manner, thou groweſt alone in ſhew, and haſt no right nor intereſt into this comfort. But further, the good man will ſay againſt himſelfe, Alas, I doe not grow, I doe not bring forth more fruit. I demand then, Vpon what ground is it that thou chargeſt thy ſelfe with not growing? Is it becauſe thou findeſt thy ſelfe not all out ſo able to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue praying and mourning, as in ſome times heretofore? I anſwere, that the true Chriſtian is likely moſt affectionate at the firſt, by reaſon of the ſtrange alteration that he findes in himſelfe. But ſay, Is not thine heart more abaſed now, in the ſence of thy faults? Art thou not more ſharpe againſt thy ſelfe, more fauourable to others? Is not thine heart now more carryed with a reſpect of God, leſſe with a reſpect of thy ſelfe? Doeſt thou not become more hardly conceite of thy ſelfe, then formerly? Surely when a mans mind is more and more alienated from himſelfe, then hee growes moſt, though hee ſeeme to himſelfe leaſt to grow, and though he thinke himſelfe leſſe able to performe many good duties, then formerly he was. Wherefore now let all Gods ſeruants ſtay vp their hearts with diuine conſolations, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themſelues a ioyfull aſſurance of their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20394:166"/>being vpright, by their increaſe in fruitfulneſſe. When a rich man caſts ouer his accounts, and findeth his ſtocke to be greater then it was, and his reuenewes to be inlarged, O how his heart leapeth within him, and what good it doth him, to perceiue that he is increaſed in wealth! Why ſhould not the godly man, whoſe wealth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpirituall, perceiuing the ſtocke of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be augmented, and his two Talents to haue gained other two, behold this with much praiſe to God, and with a great deale of content and peace in himſelfe? Wee are bound in conſcience to ſee and acknowledge the goodneſſe of God this way, and to prepare our ſelues for a further increaſe, by taking delight in the gaines which we haue already made to our ſelues in the trade of godlineſſe. I deny not, but that a godly man muſt ſtill conſider how farre he is remoued from the goale of perfection, and comparing himſelfe with the Law, complaine much of himſelfe for being vnprofitable. But there is no contradiction betwixt theſe two. A man may well conſider of his wants, to behumbled in them; and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, take notice of his increaſe to be ioyed in that: both muſt be done, and the one of theſe will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly helpe to the doing of the other. If wee doe not ioyne theſe two together, we ſhall finde much inconuenience by ſeparating them. Hee that ſtill thinketh how much he is able to doe in the worke of obedience, and doth not ſeaſonably mind himſelfe of his many defects, ſhall bee in danger of ſwelling and puffing vp. But hee that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20394:166"/>alwayes lookes to his wants and imperfections, and doth not ſometimes raiſe vp his heart in the meditation of the worke of grace within him, which hath edifyed and built him vp in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and made the little he had at firſt, far more then it was, ſhall become heereby deiected, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheerfull, and vnthankfull. Wherefore, feed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility with the one of theſe cogitations, and thankfulneſſe with the other. It is yeelded, that thou art, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, nothing; yea, leſſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in compariſon of what thou ſhouldeſt: but againe, thou art ſomething, in compariſon of what thou waſt, and what thou ſhouldeſt haue been, but for the worke of Gods grace in thee.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledge therefore, to the glory of the Vine, and the Husbandman, and to the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine owne heart: Lord, what by thy Word, what by afflictions, what by one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes that thou haſt vſed and bleſſed, and by the gracious aſſiſtance of thy Spirit, in, and with all: I doe truly perceiue my ſelfe to bee in ſome meaſure confirmed and ſtrengthened in grace, my faith is ſtronger, my patience more ſtedfaſt, mine heart more ſet vpon heauenly things, my care of ſhunning all ſinne, and the occaſions thereof, my deſire of ſeruing thee in all obedience, more conſtant and earneſt then it hath been. Bleſſed bee thy name, thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a good Husbandman, and by thy good husbandry, haſt made mee, that elſe ſhould haue beene a dry and barren branch, to bee ſomewhat
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20394:167"/>fruitfull, and to increaſe in fruitfulneſſe. Vertue is then improued to the beſt, when it is put to the vſe, of making our ſoules to giue more glory to God, and to take more comfort in him.</p>
